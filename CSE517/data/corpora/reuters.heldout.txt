Commenting on February growth of the broader monetary aggregates , the Fed said that M - 2 fell 1 . 6 billion dlrs , while M - 3 rose three billion .
Economists polled by Reuters had projected a 900 mln dlr fall in M - 1 , a 1 . 8 billion dlr drop in M - 2 and no change in M - 3 .
BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct , central bank president Jier Nogales said .
Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia ' s creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month .
He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market , where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value .
Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full .
Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets , he added .
Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March , 1984 , and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time .
Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy - backs , but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates .
Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months .
He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold , and would make a single non - negotiable offer .
He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries , let alone commercial banks .
The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest , which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions , he added .
" We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable ," Nogales said .
" Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all .
" " The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year , but I don ' t know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time ," he added .
Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia ' s four billion dlr foreign debt , 2 . 5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies , Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club .
He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace , while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989 .
Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules , he added .
He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil , who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt .
He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies , and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year .
The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year , he added .
Nogales said that Bolivia ' s net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs , compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August , 1985 .
Nogales said inflation , which soared to over 20 , 000 pct a year in the government ' s first month in office , was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months , and the plan was that it should continue at this level .
He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates .
U . S . MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE - BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U . S . wheat , feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly , Sen . Rudy Boschwitz ( R - Minn .) said .
" I think I would not support a marketing loan now ," he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains .
Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice , but has since focused support on decoupling legislation , the Boren / Boschwitiz bill .
A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production , especially in high - yielding areas , would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly , he said .

AMVESTORS FINANCIAL & lt ; AVFC > SETS STOCK DIVIDEND AmVestors Financial Corp said it declared a 25 pct stock dividend payable June 19 to holders of record June one , subject to an increase in authorized shares .

U . S . HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned - down version of legislation designed to toughen U . S . trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U . S . goods .
The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week , but major changes are not expected , congressional sources said .
" This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word ' protectionism '," Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat said .
The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year .
But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep . Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U . S . by countries such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan .
Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , has not decided the exact form of his amendment , an aide said .
Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries .
The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls , incentives for research , expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U . S . competitiveness .
The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees .
It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U . S . economic security would be harmed by U . S . actions against other countries .
The bill would make it easier for U . S . industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products .
It extends until January 1993 , the administration ' s authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade .
And , it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on copyrights , patents and telecommunications goods .

INFLATION STILL A CONCERN , VOLCKER SAYS Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation .
" A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern , both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve ," he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders here .
He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets , which would push import prices up sharply .
He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability .
" Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy , the consequences for interest rates , for exchange rates , and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable ... recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy ," the Fed chairman said .
Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk dissipating the flow of foreign capital .

LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS Live cattle futures posted a robust rally today after a major beef packing company said it would end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City , Neb .
April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed at 64 . 45 cents a pound , up 0 . 83 cent , as the market expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant restarts operations .
Iowa Beef Processors , a division of Occidental Petroleum , said it planned to reopen the plant , one of the largest in the nation , on March 16 .
The plant has been closed since Dec . 14 , the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired .
The plant employs 2 , 800 workers and can slaughter several thousand animals a day , a company spokesman said .
The company said it locked out union workers because they threatened to disrupt operations .
It was unclear whether union meatpackers would return to work .
They rejected the company ' s latest contract offer March 5 .
Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors circulated that the lockout was ending , and gains were further fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle .
The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and frozen pork bellies , which also were supported by indications that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate than previously expected .
Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday , said Nauman Barakat , petroleum analyst in New York with Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co . Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices recover from early weakness , traders said .
Gold futures rallied , partly in response to strength in the silver market , on the Commodity Exchange in New York .
Silver prices rallied after a U . S . brokerage house recommended its customers buy the metal , traders said .
Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that Colombia lowered the price of its exports , traders said .
Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European Commission on Wednesday .
Soybeans were higher , wheat lower and corn mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade .
Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation Reserve Program , which pays farmers to leave highly erodible land idle instead of planting a crop , traders said .
Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt exports of soybeans from Brazil , where the harvest is just beginning , also underpinned prices , they said .
Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to trends on price charts , they said .
PERMIAN BASIN & lt ; PBT > PROVEN RESERVES FALL Permian Basin Royalty Trust said that as of December 31 , 1986 , its estimated proved reserves totaled 18 . 5 mln barrels of oil and 52 . 9 mln MCF , or thousand cubic feet , of gas .
This compares with yearend 1985 proved reserves estimates of 26 . 4 mln barrels of oil and 78 . 6 mln MCF of gas , Permian said .
Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved reserves were 335 . 6 mln dlrs , down from 814 . 2 mln dlrs in 1985 .
Permian said the present value of estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165 . 3 mln dlrs , compared with 374 . 3 mln dlrs .
It said the downward revisions in both proved reserves and estimated future net revenues resulted from decreased prices for oil and gas .
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS REFINANCING ACCORD president jaime lusinchi defended the 20 . 3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government recently signed , saying it will open new credit flows and bring needed foreign investment to venezuela .
In his annual state of the nation speech , lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors , despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own .
In the 90 - minute speech to the congress , lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration , which took office in february 1984 .
He pointed to the 3 . 3 pct growth in non - oil gdp in 1986 and to a " moderate " 12 pct inflation rate .
Lusinchi said the 20 . 3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed feb . 27 put an end to a process which had been ' the calvary of our nation over the post four years .
' In the refinancing accord , he said , venezuela managed to achieve ' the most inmportant thing , which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad , essential for the financing of development and the ( financing ) of trade and investment .
' Once all the details of the agreement are finalized , he said , venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects .
" our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital , but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela ," he said .
Under the agreement signed february 27 , venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years , while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 1 / 8 to 7 / 8 of a pct over libor .
At the same time , payments over the next three years were lowered from 3 . 450 to 1 . 350 billion dlrs .
Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future governments .

BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil ' s state - oil company , Petrobras , cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil , a Petrobras official said .
Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil ' s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month .
The shipment of 2 . 2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil .
But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract , then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment .
Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil ' s terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere .
" Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia ' s traditional client since 1955 .
If they do not accept our conditions now , it will be much better for us , because with the market prices more or less the same , buying from Iraq and China is an advantage ," he said .
Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil , importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil , but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil , he said .
Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two - week stoppage by Brazilian seamen , Petrobras oil stocks are " reasonably balanced .
" Saudi Arabia is Brazil ' s second biggest oil supplier , with an average 115 , 000 bpd .
Iraq is the main supplier with 235 , 000 bpd .
China comes third , with 58 , 000 bpd .
" If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship , fine , I am sure that if they do , we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere ," Santana added .

NO GRAIN TO THE USSR IN LATEST WEEK -- USDA There were no shipments of U . S . grain or soybeans to the Soviet Union in the week ended March 12 , according to the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s latest Export Sales report .
The USSR has purchased 1 . 0 mln tonnes of U . S . corn for delivery in the fourth year of the U . S .- USSR grain agreement .
Total shipments in the third year of the U . S .- USSR grains agreement , which ended September 30 , amounted to 152 , 600 tonnes of wheat , 6 , 808 , 100 tonnes of corn and 1 , 518 , 700 tonnes of soybeans .
Shipments to the USSR in the second year of the agreeement amounted to 2 , 887 , 200 tonnes of wheat and 15 , 750 , 100 tonnes of corn .
U . S . SUGAR IMPORTS DOWN IN WEEK - USDA Sugar imports subject to the U . S . sugar import quota during the week ended January 9 , the initial week of the 1987 sugar quota year , totaled 5 , 988 short tons versus 46 , 254 tons the previous week , the Agriculture Department said .
The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year ( January - December ) has been set at 1 , 001 , 430 short tons compared with 1 , 850 , 000 tons in the 1986 quota year , which was extended three months to December 31 .

INDIA GETS 140 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN The World Bank said it has approved a 140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country ' s dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources .

The bank said the recipient of the 20 - year loan will be Oil India Ltd ( OIL ), which is the smaller of two public Indian petroleum exploration and production companies .
FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY U . S . bank reserve , monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is " on hold " and may not be changed for weeks or even months , economists said .
" The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy ," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co . " These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect , nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change ," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc . Fed data released today were all in line with economists ' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks .
The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs , up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period , but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that .
It said that banks ' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously .
Finally , the Fed said that the M - 1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February , with the broader M - 2 measure down 1 . 6 billion dlrs and M - 3 up an even three billion dlrs .
Analysts said that M - 1 last month grew at a negative 1 . 3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0 . 7 pct for M - 2 and actual positive growth of 1 . 0 pct annualized for M - 3 .
February levels of M - 2 and M - 3 left the aggregates 18 . 2 and 20 . 8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987 .
The annual growth target for both is 5 - 1 / 2 to 8 - 1 / 2 pct .
There is no M - 1 target .
" In the near term , there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy , even apart from the slowdown in money growth ," said Stephen Slifer , economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc . Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February ' s anemic growth rates .
However , they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness .
Commenting on February ' s decline in the key M - 2 aggregate , Slifer said the main cause was a 3 . 2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks .
This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while , he said , so February ' s weakness is not likely to persist .
Slifer expects modest M - 2 and M - 3 growth rates of 3 - 1 / 2 to four pct during March .
Griggs said that M - 2 and M - 3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed .
Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves .
Given the economy ' s fragility in many sectors , the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise , rather than lower , interest rates when it next changes policy .
" Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them , although Fed funds held above six pct ," said Williams of Bankers Trust .
Funds averaged 6 . 12 pct in the week to Wednesday , up from 6 . 06 pct in the prior week .
The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday , 2 . 5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday .
On Tuesday , it added reserves directly through two - day System repurchases .
Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market - driven .
They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs .
COLOMBIA ' S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices , finance minister Cesar Gaviria said .
Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price , or reintegro , of 1 . 10 dlr per lb ex - dock New York , Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile .
" In the first stage , we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia ' s coffee export policy ," he said .
Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends .
Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation ( ICO ) export quotas may not occur in the short term .
ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re - introduction of export quotas , suspended in February 1986 .
Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume .
" Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee , between 9 . 6 and 10 mln bags ( of 60 kilos ), and will do so without an agreement among producers ," he said .
He ruled out a much higher volume of exports , or up to 13 . 5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles , " because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market .
" Colombia exported a record 11 . 5 mln bags in the 1985 / 86 coffee year which ended last September 30 .
Echoing Gaviria ' s words , Jorge Cardenas , manager of the national coffee growers ' federation , said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances .
" There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt .
Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future ," he told journalists .
Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil ' s future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week .
Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved .
Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue , Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear .
He said Brazil ' s current quota " reflects the reality of the market , allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand ," but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it .
Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible , which did not happen .
INDIA GETS 140 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN The World Bank said it approved a 140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country ' s dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own petroleum resources .

VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50 , 000 BPD OF CRUDE Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50 , 000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments , Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today .
He said that under the terms of this loan , agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador ' s Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite , Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August .
Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador ' s 140 , 000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week .
Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action .
Venezuela has an output quota of 1 . 495 bpd , while Ecuador ' s is 210 , 000 bpd .
Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100 , 000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses .
Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300 , 000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs .
The oil , part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela , will be processed at Guayaquil refineries .
" If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt ," he said .

MIYAZAWA SAYS EXCHANGE RATES WILL STAY STABLE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long .
The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability .
Asked to comment on remarks by some U . S . Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar , Miyazawa said only the U . S . President and the U . S . Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates .
TWO BRAZILIAN SHIPPING FIRMS SETTLE WITH STRIKERS Two small shipping companies have reached a pay deal with striking seamen , but union leaders said most of Brazil ' s 40 , 000 seamen were still on strike .
A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies , Globo and Flumar , which have less than 200 employees each .
The two - week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange .
Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will not force a settlement of the strike , which was ruled illegal last Friday .

ADSTEAM RIGHTS ISSUE TO RAISE 228 MLN DLRS The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd & lt ; ADSA . S > ( Adsteam ) said its one - for - five rights issue at 11 . 50 dlrs a share will raise 228 . 5 mln dlrs for general working capital and investment , both in Australia and overseas .
The group announced the issue with its first half earnings and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed by a one - for - four bonus issue .
Adsteam ' s equity - accounted net earnings rose to 75 . 05 mln dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55 . 68 mln a year earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16 .
Adsteam shares eased to 14 . 20 dlrs from an opening 14 . 60 and yesterday ' s close of 14 . 50 on the issue announcement .
The issue will be underwritten by & lt ; Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd > and & lt ; McCaughan Dyson Ltd > apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam ' s associate and largest shareholder , department store retailer & lt ; David Jones Ltd >.

U . S . OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT Senior U . S . Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets .
Beryl Sprinkel , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , reiterated the Reagan Administration ' s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth .
By contrast , Rudolph Penner , Director of the Congressional Budget Office , said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987 .
Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments .
He also suggested a line - item veto , which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it , to limit wasteful spending .
Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely .
Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2 . 7 pct growth in U . S . Real gross national product ( GNP ) in 1987 and 3 . 5 pct in 1988 .
Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable , Sprinkel said , " It looks pretty good to me .
We ' ve had two very strong employment reports .
" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate , adding , " It looks like they ' re on track .
" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit , Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact .
The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives , he said .
" Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long - run consequences of tax reform ," Sprinkel said .
" In 1986 , this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family .
" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit .
In fiscal 1986 ending September , federal spending amounted to 23 . 8 pct of GNP , while federal receipts absorbed 18 . 5 pct of GNP , leaving a deficit of 5 . 3 pct , he said .
Sprinkel said that , compared with fiscal 1978 , the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2 . 7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same .
" Contrary to the conventional wisdom , therefore , the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years ," Sprinkel said .
" This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation - induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981 ," he added .
However , the Congressional Budget Office ' s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided .
" Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress , indeed with increases in defence spending , now all the options ( for reducing the budget deficit ) are unpleasant ," he said .
Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U . S .
Caused by the " biggest sustained inflation in our nation ' s history ," which helped foster widespread distrust of government .
" The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level ," Penner said .
" But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs .
Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot .
" Penner sees little hope the Gramm - Rudman - Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year .
He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed .
" I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there ' s no ... Way to enforce it ," Penner said .
Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut .
He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one - time measures , such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets .
" Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes , like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988 .
That saved more than two billion dlrs ," Penner said .
AUSTRALIAN TERMS OF TRADE WORSEN IN LAST QUARTER Australia ' s terms of trade fell by a further 3 . 5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after declining 0 . 8 pct in the third quarter and 2 . 7 pct a year earlier , the Statistics Bureau said .
It said the seasonally adjusted current account deficit of 3 . 22 billion dlrs in the quarter would have dropped to 912 mln if not for the terms of trade decline .
The fourth quarter decline followed a 1 . 1 pct fall in export prices and a 2 . 4 pct rise in import prices , it said .
The Bureau noted Australia ' s terms of trade had fallen by 19 . 9 pct since the fourth quarter of 1983 .
CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand , in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year , traders and the official press said .
He Kang , Minister of Agriculture , Animal Husbandry and Fisheries , said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details .
One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks , cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods .
" It will not be easy to cut domestic demand , even in a state - controlled economy .
China may have to import ," he said .
Customs figures show imports fell to 1 . 182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1 . 909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25 , 165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54 , 000 in January 1986 .
The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986 / 87 crushing season ( September - April ) will be 1 . 18 mln tonnes short of demand .
The paper put 1986 / 87 output at 4 . 82 mln , down from 5 . 24 mln in 1985 / 86 , and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes .
" In the last two years , acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen , sugar mills are underutilised , output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day ," it said .
" The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand ," it added .
It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops , which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them .
The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane .
He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne , against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane .
Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs , it said .
In Fujian , the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520 . 1 in 1980 , cutting the mills ' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217 . 9 , it added .
The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985 / 86 crushing season losing money .
China has 521 sugar mills .
A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986 / 87 ( September - August ) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong , which produced 45 pct of China ' s sugar in calendar 1985 , and a smaller drop in Fujian , which produced 11 pct of China ' s sugar in calendar 1985 .
He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar - producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities .
But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan , which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop , has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986 / 87 , because cane - growing is more economic there , he said .
He put sugar stocks at 2 . 333 mln tonnes in September 1986 .
A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end - January .
" Now they are falling but ( they ) have not reached the critical level , compelling China to import quickly ," he said .
" China has options not easily available in western countries .
It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly ," he said .
The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986 , because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which , he said , are likely to continue until at least end - 1988 .
He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state - owned mills , with a small amount sold raw to consumers .
" Most of the mills are old and inefficient , with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s ," he said .
He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct , with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct .
JAPAN SETS 1987 / 88 FIRST HALF BEEF IMPORT QUOTA The Agriculture Ministry said it set Japan ' s beef import quota for the six months from April 1 at 93 , 000 tonnes , up from 83 , 000 in the second half of 1986 / 87 and 85 , 000 a year earlier .
Under an agreement with the U . S . And Australia , Japan has been increasing imports by 9 , 000 tonnes a year from March 31 , 1985 , to reach a projected 177 , 000 tonnes in the year to March 31 , 1988 .
JAPAN DENIES BREAKING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT Japan denied breaking a pact with the U . S . On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord .
" We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of course there are some problems ," a spokesman for the International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters .
He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products .
" We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time ," he said .
The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices , but added : " It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem .
" The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock - down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase U . S . Semiconductor sales in Japan .
The U . S . Senate Finance Committee this week called on President Reagan in a non - binding resolution to retaliate against Japan for violating the agreement .
JAPAN MINISTER SAYS ABOUT 170 YEN APPROPRIATE International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan ' s small - and medium - sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen ' s rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen .
He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations .
Finance ministers of Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels .
The dollar had closed here at 153 . 77 yen on February 20 .
GERMAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0 . 4 PCT IN FEBRUARY West German wholesale prices fell 0 . 4 pct in February from January to stand 6 . 9 pct lower than in February 1986 , the Federal Statistics Office said .

Among higher wholesale prices were those for fresh vegetables , up 17 pct , fresh fruit up 12 pct and eggs up 8 . 9 pct , the statistics office said in a statement .

AUSTRALIAN BEEF OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING IN 1987 Australian beef output is forecast to decline to 1 . 34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1 . 36 mln in 1988 from 1 . 44 mln in 1986 , the Australian Meat and Live - Stock Corp ( AMLC ) said .
Exports of beef / veal are also predicted to decline to 480 , 000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515 , 000 in 1986 , and then rally to 490 , 000 in 1988 , the AMLC said in a summary of its bi - annual meat and livestock forecasts .
It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23 . 2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast .
Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market , both domestically and overseas , will continue , the AMLC said .
The slow herd build - up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year , it said .
The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year .
It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production .
In 1985 it was 52 pct .
The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar , the AMLC said .
It also forecast that Australia ' s four major markets , the U . S ., Japan , Canada and Taiwan , will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets .
They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports .
CHINA ' S JANUARY GRAIN EXPORTS FALL China ' s grain exports in January totaled 386 , 157 tonnes , down 22 . 1 pct from January 1986 , customs figures show .
They gave no detailed breakdown .
The official China Economic News quoted the figures as showing tea exports rose 9 . 7 pct to 8 , 474 tonnes during the month .
Imports of wool rose 117 . 6 pct to 10 , 248 tonnes over the same period , the figures show .
SWISS FEBRUARY TRADE DEFICIT 629 . 7 MLN FRANCS Switzerland had a trade deficit of 629 . 7 mln Swiss francs in February compared with a revised 209 . 4 mln deficit in January and 723 . 2 mln shortfall in February 1986 , the Federal Customs Office said .
February imports were 6 . 00 billion francs against exports of 5 . 37 billion .
Imports rose in real terms by 5 . 1 pct against February 1986 while exports rose by a real 4 . 6 pct , the office said .
But a further improvement in the terms of trade left the deficit smaller than last year .
Last February ' s figure had also been hit by the import of two passenger aircraft .

JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the state ' s Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year starting April 1 , officials of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said .
Under the plan , 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10 , 000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes ( CGRT ) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT .
The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3 . 3 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 3 . 1 mln the following year .
The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977 / 78 , under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines .
The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31 .
The cartels , self - imposed and self - regulated , are not legally binding , but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them .
The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump .
SWISS WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0 . 3 PCT IN FEBRUARY Swiss wholesale prices fell by 0 . 3 pct in February , giving a drop of 4 . 3 pct from February 1986 , the Federal Office of Industry , Trade and Labour said .
Prices had been unchanged in January , giving an annual drop of 4 . 6 pct .
They fell by 2 . 6 pct in the year to February 1986 .
The wholesale price index , base 1963 , stood at 168 . 5 in February from 176 . 1 last year .
The office said the fall was largely due to lower prices for energy , raw materials and semi - finished goods .
Consumer goods prices rose slightly .

JAPAN CABINET APPROVES BILL ON GOLD COIN ISSUES The cabinet has approved a bill making it easier for the government to issue commemorative coins , a Finance Ministry official said .
The bill , which must still be approved by parliament , would take effect in April 1988 .
It would allow the government to issue 1 , 000 , 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 yen coins without special legislation , although higher - valued coins would still need a special law , the official said .
At present it can only issue coins of 500 yen or less .

He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a two - day meeting of South - East Asian Energy Ministers that he saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel .
" The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth quarters ," Subroto said .

OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE , SUBROTO SAYS Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15 . 8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target .
He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs .
" We are deliberately defending the price , so OPEC production is less than 15 . 8 ( mln ) at the moment ," he stated .
Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel , he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June .
" We will discuss the market situation then ," he added .
He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because " there is no need for the meeting .
" He did not elaborate .
The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week .
JAPAN REJECTS U . S .
OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U . S . Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U . S .
Microchip maker to a Japanese firm .
" They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues ," Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry ' s North American Division told Reuters .
U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of & lt ; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp > to Japan ' s Fujitsu Ltd & lt ; ITSU . T >, U . S . Officials said yesterday .
Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U . S . Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment .
Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale .
U . S . Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U . S . Market for supercomputers while Japan ' s supercomputer market remains closed to U . S .
Sales .
Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner , Schlumberger Ltd & lt ; SLB >, does not include Fairchild ' s main defence - related division .
In addition , Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers .
Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers .
Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U . S . Supercomputer makers , they said .
Takemoto also dismissed U . S .
Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U . S .
Antitrust law , saying " the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U . S . Semiconductor market .
" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase , industry analysts said .
The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U . S . Supercomputer sales , they said .
U . S . Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U . S . Supercomputer sales despite U . S . Firms ' technological lead in the field .
" The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied , and this is a bullying ploy ," Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said .
However , the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U . S .
Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors .
" The real issue is xenophobia in ( the U . S .) Silicon Valley ," said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co . U . S .- Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan ' s Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan ' s market .
A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement , problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact .
" It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem ," he told Reuters .
Despite the furore , Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year , a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters .
BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP TO MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it invited an early round of bill offers to help ease tight conditions in the money market .
The bank estimated today ' s liquidity shortage at about 1 . 10 billion stg .
Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take - up would drain 1 . 21 billion stg from the system while a rise in the note circulation and below target bankers ' balances would take out 265 mln and 180 mln respectively , the bank said .
Against this , exchequer transactions would add a net 535 mln stg .

KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED Kampuchea harvested more than two mln tonnes of rice paddy in 1986 , up on the crops of the previous two years , the official SPK news agency said yesterday .
Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than one mln tonnes , slightly up on 800 , 000 in 1984 .
SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1 . 5 mln to 1 . 93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2 . 5 mln tonnes this calendar year .
Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1 . 3 mln tonnes of milled rice , above the 1 . 25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the minimum its 7 . 5 mln people need .
CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT , PAPER SAYS China ' s 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3 . 54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand , the China Daily said .
Demand in 1986 rose 10 . 9 pct over 1985 .
Output in 1986 fell from 4 . 15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6 . 2 mln in 1984 , official figures show .
The China Daily attributed the decline to several factors , including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build - up of stocks .
According to Customs figures , cotton exports rose to 558 , 089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347 , 026 in 1985 .
To increase output quickly , the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels , the newspaper said .
Its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for , it added .
The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south China should be maintained , and growing in the north should be concentrated in Hebei , Shandong , Henan and Xinjiang .
It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain , edible oil and other crops , but gave no more details .
MIYAZAWA SAYS PRESENT YEN NOT NECESSARILY IDEAL Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar / yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy .

The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates , he said .
The accord stipulated that current rates reflect fundamentals of the six nations - Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany .

PETROBRAS CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil ' s state oil company Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose reasons , a Petrobras official said .
Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil ' s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month .
The shipment of 2 . 2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption .
He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks .
In February , Brazil had contracted to buy 125 , 000 bpd from the Saudis until June .
Saudi Arabia is Brazil ' s second biggest oil supplier , with an average 115 , 000 bpd .
Iraq is the main supplier with 235 , 000 bpd .
China comes third , with 58 , 000 bpd .
" If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship ... I am sure that if they do , we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere ," Santana added .
Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract , then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment .
The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment , he added .
" We telexed them saying that if they insisted , we would rather cancel the contract and buy the product elsewhere ," Santana said .
After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract , the Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of Brazil ' s credit guarantees , he said .
MANNESMANN CONSIDERING MAJORITY STAKE IN FICHTEL A Mannesmann AG & lt ; MMWG . F > spokesman said the company has lodged an application with the Federal Cartel Office for approval of a possible majority stake in car parts company & lt ; Fichtel und Sachs AG >.
He described the application as a precautionary move and said no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been reached .
Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to buy a 37 . 5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm Sachs , the grandson of the firm ' s founder .
The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the other shares to create a majority stake in the firm .
Fichtel ' s other principal shareholders are Commerzbank AG & lt ; CBKG . F >, with 35 . 01 pct , and Salzgitter AG & lt ; ISLG . F >, with 24 . 98 pct .
Spokesmen declined to comment directly on the possibility of selling Fichtel shares to Mannesmann .
Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37 . 5 pct stake in Fichtel ' s holding company Sachs AG in the first quarter .
Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of intent on the 37 . 5 pct stake but completion was being delayed by legal questions surrounding the inheritance .
SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS Sandoz AG & lt ; SANZ . Z > would have reported a percentage rise in net profits " close to double figures " rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November ' s warehouse fire , a senior company official said .
The official , who declined to be identified , told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle , which caused severe pollution of the Rhine .
Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share .
This year began well , with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year , the official said .
The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22 .
Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident .
The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the " one pct " of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire .
Sandoz has not given any figure for claims , which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident .
However , the official said the final figure would be " much less than that cited in earlier comments .
" He gave no further details .
In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba - Geigy & lt ; CIGZ . Z >, which reported last month , Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar , the official said .
Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct , with market share increases in the United States and Japan .
But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect , which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8 . 36 billion francs , the Sandoz official said .
Net profit at Ciba - Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1 . 16 billion francs , while sales fell by 12 pct to 15 . 95 billion francs .
The third major Swiss chemical company , F . Hoffmann - La Roche and Co & lt ; HOFZ . Z > has not yet reported its results .
ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK - EVEN IN 1987 Schweizerische Aluminimum AG & lt ; ALUZ . Z > ( Alusuisse ) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986 , chief executive Hans Jucker said .
" The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future ," he said .
" We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even .
That presupposes , however , that our industrial environment does not worsen .
" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses .
Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985 .
Gross sales were 5 . 93 billion francs after 8 . 51 billion and net turnover 5 . 65 billion after 8 . 00 billion .
Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985 .
But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years ' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset .
Together with other one - off charges , Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs , up from 472 mln in 1985 .
It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining , after provisions , from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States .
There were no extraordinary gains in 1985 .
Jucker said the losses , plus those carried forward from 1985 , had wiped out the company ' s remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels , forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut , to be approved by shareholders on April 22 .
Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this " radical elimination of the mortgages of the past " painful , but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy .
Haerri said despite the losses , the company ' s liquidity was strong .
Bank debt had been cut by about one - third to 2 . 56 billion francs against the end - 1985 level of 3 . 85 billion .
Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5 . 7 pct of turnover against a mere 1 . 4 pct in 1985 .
In addition , to reassure other creditors , Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland & lt ; SBGZ . Z >, Swiss Bank Corp & lt ; SBVZ . Z > and Credit Suisse & lt ; CRSZ . Z >, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan .
The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses , Haerri said .
Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent , and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987 .
Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset , and so had restated the accounts .
That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln , 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln , 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln .
The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders ' equity of 1 . 15 billion francs instead of 1 . 75 billion , and similar alternations were made for previous years .
After 1986 losses , shareholder ' s equity stood at only 895 mln francs .
JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS IN LAST 1986 QUARTER UP Current profits of Japan ' s major firms in the October - December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5 , 654 billion yen against a 2 . 6 pct year - on - year rise in the preceding quarter , the Finance Ministry said .
The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22 . 5 pct profit increase in non - manufacturing industries , supported by an 88 . 7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate , according to a ministry survey .
Total sales of the 15 , 308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll , fell one pct to 217 , 217 billion yen against a 1 . 2 pct fall the previous quarter .
Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 13 . 7 pct to 2 , 394 billion yen against a 22 . 1 pct fall in the preceding quarter , the ministry said .
Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 3 . 9 pct to 8 , 004 billion yen , compared with a 1 . 4 percent fall the previoius quarter .
Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery .
U . S .
LENDS SUDAN 57 MLN DLRS FOR WHEAT PURCHASES The U . S . Is to lend Sudan 57 mln dlrs to buy 309 , 000 tonnes of wheat and 73 , 000 tonnes of wheat flour , according to an agreement signed here .
Under the agreement Sudan will receive 50 mln dlrs for the commodities and the rest for sea transportation .
The loan is repayable in 40 years , including a 10 - year grace period .
Interest will be two pct for the grace period and three pct over the repayment period of 30 years .
ALUSUISSE PLANS FURTHER ALUMINIUM CAPACITY CUTS Schweizerische Aluminium AG & lt ; ALUZ . Z > ( Alusuisse ) plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium smelting capacity and more concentration of higher value - added products , chief executive Hans Jucker said .
Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September , company officials said current smelting capacity of 390 , 000 tonnes a year would be cut to between 250 , 000 and 260 , 000 tonnes by 1989 or 1990 .
They did not say where cuts might be made .
Two years ago , before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in the United States to local management and staff , Alusuisse had an annual capacity of 800 , 000 tonnes .

BRAZIL ANTI - INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY inflation plan , initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy , is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices , widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis .
Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices , fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country ' s 250 pct inflation rate .
But within a year the plan has all but collapsed .
" The situation now is worse than it was .
Although there was inflation , at least the economy worked ," a leading bank economist said .
The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account .
In 1984 and 1985 Brazil ' s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt .
For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat , with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs .
But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln .

JAPAN CABINET APPROVES BILL ON GOLD COIN ISSUES The cabinet has approved a bill making it easier for the government to issue commemorative coins , a Finance Ministry official said .
The bill , which must still be approved by parliament , would take effect in April 1988 .
It would allow the government to issue 1 , 000 , 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 yen coins without special legislation , although higher - valued coins would still need a special law , the official said .
At present it can only issue coins of 500 yen or less .
JAPAN MINISTER SAYS ABOUT 170 YEN APPROPRIATE International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan ' s small - and medium - sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen ' s rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen .
He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations .
Finance ministers of Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels .
The dollar had closed here at 153 . 77 yen on February 20 .
TWO BRAZILIAN SHIPPING FIRMS SETTLE WITH STRIKERS Two small shipping companies have reached a pay deal with striking seamen , but union leaders said most of Brazil ' s 40 , 000 seamen were still on strike .
A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies , Globo and Flumar , which have less than 200 employees each .
The two - week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange .
Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will not force a settlement of the strike , which was ruled illegal last Friday .
MIYAZAWA SAYS EXCHANGE RATES WILL STAY STABLE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long .
The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability .
Asked to comment on remarks by some U . S . Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar , Miyazawa said only the U . S . President and the U . S . Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates .
SUBROTO SEES OIL MARKET CONTINUING BULLISH Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said he sees the oil market continuing bullish , with underlying demand expected to rise later in the year .
He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a two - day meeting of South - East Asian Energy Ministers that he saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel .
" The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth quarters ," Subroto said .
Asked about the prospect for oil prices , he said : " I think they will stabilise around 18 dlrs , although there is a little turbulence ..." " Of course the spot price will fluctuate , but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs ," he added .
OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE , SUBROTO SAYS Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15 . 8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target .
He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs .
" We are deliberately defending the price , so OPEC production is less than 15 . 8 ( mln ) at the moment ," he stated .
Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel , he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June .
" We will discuss the market situation then ," he added .
He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because " there is no need for the meeting .
" He did not elaborate .
The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week .
BANK OF JAPAN CALLS FOR LONG - TERM EFFORTS ON TRADE The short - term effect of foreign exchange rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances appears to be waning , and long - term efforts are required to cut Japan ' s chronic dependence on external demand , the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report .
Japan ' s trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future , the central bank said .
Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system , it added .
BURMESE PADDY PRODUCTION LOWER IN 1986 / 87 Burma ' s paddy production fell to 729 . 4 mln baskets in fiscal year 1986 - 1987 ( to end March ) from 737 . 3 mln in 1985 - 1986 , a cabinet report to parliament said .
A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs .
Paddy output in 1984 - 1985 was 699 . 1 mln baskets , it said .
Burma ' s " Green Revolution " sparked by the introduction of high - yield variety paddy strains in the mid - 1970s appears to have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past two years , economists said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 168 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 168 mln stg of assistance to help offset a shortage it now estimated at 1 . 05 billion stg , revised down from 1 . 10 billion .
It bought 21 mln stg of bank bills outright , 20 mln in band one at 10 - 3 / 8 pct and one mln in band two at 10 - 5 / 16 pct .
In addition , it bought 98 mln stg of bills for resale on March 30 and 49 mln stg for resale April 8 at an interest rate of 10 - 7 / 16 pct .

Meanwhile , discussions on a new work agreement in the port ' s grain sector , due to resume next week , are stalemated , although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector , the employers ' spokesman added .

DUTCH PORT UNION CALLS OFF GENERAL CARGO STRIKES Dutch port and transport union , FNV , has called off the strikes against planned redundancies that have hit Rotterdam port ' s general cargo sector for the past eight weeks , strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a mass meeting .
The decision followed yesterday ' s ruling by an Amsterdam court preventing the sector ' s employers continuing with current plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again on May 7 , Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo sector ' s 4 , 000 workers today .
The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies , and therefore could not proceed .
" There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted ," Rosenmuller said .
But he added that the strikes , which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990 , could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re - apply for permission for the redundancies .
SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re - applying for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval for the redundancies within a month .

UGANDA RE - ROUTES COFFEE EXPORTS THROUGH KISUMU Long delays at the railway crossing on the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re - route its coffee exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu across Lake Victoria , Ugandan officials based in Kenya said .
Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons , they said .
Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to three at the Malaba rail border crossing , a Ugandan Railways official said .
" Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu ," he said .
However , an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja , causing bottlenecks on the lake route too .
Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported delays in coffee export shipments last January due to congestion on the lake ferries .
Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda ' s export earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid the higher costs of road haulage .

ALUSUISSE PLANS 50 PCT CAPITAL CUT Schweizerische Aluminium AG , Alusuisse , plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year , chief executive Hans Jucker said .
Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped , but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year .
The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct , he said .
However , Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan .
Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today ' s announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct , the bourse said .
Trading would resume again on Monday .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe , economists say .
But many economists say the system , which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands , remains in its infancy .
Its new currency , the European Currency Unit ( Ecu ), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar .
And on Wednesday , the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe ' s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world ' s first Ecu coin .
But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system ' s founding fathers , ex - West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing .
Under this phase , originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up , decision - making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund .
But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters .
" The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common ," said one economist who has closely watched the system ' s development .
The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies , accentuating what the economists say is the system ' s greatest weakness , its vulnerability to a weak dollar .
Over the past 18 months , as the U . S . Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies , the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system .
MORE As the mark soared against the dollar , it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors .
And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark ' s rise , the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community .
Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc , Italian lira , the Irish punt and Danish crown .
Another frustration has been Britain ' s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound , still a major world currency , outside the system .
No change in the British government ' s attitude is expected before the country ' s next general elections , due by mid - 1988 .
Meanwhile , the system ' s last realignment , the 11th since it was set up , prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC ' s highly - secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it .
Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month .
But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details .
They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change .
" Technical measures won ' t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness .
For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level ," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank ' s economic research department .
Economists say the system ' s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates .
If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence , they predict .
GENERAL MILLS & lt ; GIS > SEES STRONG 4TH QTR RESULTS General Mills Inc , reporting stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22 , said it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter .
The company said it expects to report " strong earnings per share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987 .
" It said this should be achieved despite expected non - operating charges in the final quarter .
General Mills said these charges will likely offset non - operating gains , which included six cts a share in the first half .
General Mills said at the end of the third quarter , its return on average equity was 31 . 6 pct .
It said major factors contributing to the third quarter improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer Foods , continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and strong performance in Specialty Retailing .
The company reported quarterly earnings of 56 . 9 mln dlrs , or 64 cts a share , up from 46 . 4 mln dlrs , or 52 cts a share a year ago .
Sales rose to 1 . 31 billion dlrs from 1 . 13 billion dlrs .

HAITI ANNOUNCES FIND OF ORE - RICH GOLD FIELD The Ministry of Mines has announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois in Haiti ' s mineral - rich North .
At a press conference yesterday , a Ministry spokesman reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore , with each ton capable of containing 7 , 666 grams of gold .
The spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find , discovered on Wednesday , was worth .
However , mining could only begin after foreign partners invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment , the spokesman said .
The Haitian government has never before operated a gold mine , but the United Nations has recently completed a three year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa as sites of important gold deposits .
In 1971 , the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives , operated by a Canadian firm , closed down after years of mining a concentrate containing gold as well as copper .
" The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money ," said a former official of Sedren Mine .
" But like everything else there ' s a catch .
The gold has to be extracted , and first someone has to come up with the money to finance the operation ," the official , who asked not to be named , told Reuters .

NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement , INRA , are approaching the make - or - break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance , delegates said .
Manaspas Xuto of Thailand , chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference , is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues .
When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week .
The talks are due to last until March 20 .
Xuto said , " There is nothing concrete yet , but the atmosphere is good .
" The discussions are expected to continue late into the night , and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings .
Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic .
At present , if the market price has been above or below the reference price ( set at 201 . 66 Malaysian / Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement ) for six months , the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council .
Consumers are asking that , in these circumstances , the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more .
Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure .
Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price .
It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price , called the " lower indicative price ," under certain circumstances .
This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price , and the " may buy " ( or " may sell ") and " must buy " or " must sell " levels , without changing the " lower indicative price " -- which is set at 150 Malaysian / Singapore cents in the current pact .
Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question , producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present .
SOVIETS RUMORED TO HAVE BOUGHT MORE U . S . CORN The Soviet Union is rumored this morning to have bought up to 1 . 5 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , export trade sources said .
The amount was not confirmed , but the talk was widespread through the trade .
Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors , which were expected to boost futures prices on today ' s open .
The Soviet Union recently bought over 1 . 0 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U . S . agriculture officials .
Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official ' s statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near - term needs .

The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries .

YEUTTER SAYS DLR LEVEL BASED ON ECONOMIC POLICY U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations ' financial , monetary and tax policies .
But , he said , in a speech and remarks to the Heritage Foundation , that in the end " the marketplace will ultimately rule the day .
" Asked about the future of the dollar , he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations .
Yeutter said " if nations do the right kinds of things in financial , monetary and tax policies , then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates , and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable .
" But he said , on the other hand , that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation , " It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment .

STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U . S . OIL RESERVES A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry .
U . S . policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels , from its present 500 mln , to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise .
The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies , a private group , also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques .
It predicted prices would remain at about 15 - 18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s , with imports at about 30 pct of U . S . consumption .
It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports .

BALLY & lt ; BLY > CONSIDERING SALE OF SIX FLAGS Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit and would use the proceeds to pay off debt .
In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks , Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain to the public .
The company will register a proposed offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of the health clubs soon , spokesman William Peltier told Reuters .
" Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration ," Peltier said in response to an inquiry .
He said the company would use much of the income from the amusement park chain , were it to be sold , to repay debt .
Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs , analysts said .
The health club chain , the nation ' s largest , is valued at 350 to 375 mln dlrs , they said .
Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six Flags by several prospective buyers .
The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1 . 6 mln dlrs mountain of debt .
Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget Inc & lt ; GNG . N >.
The purchase pushed its long - term debt to 1 . 6 billion dlrs , or almost 2 . 7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs .
Bally ' s 325 - unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in 1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs , or about 28 pct of Bally ' s total revenues of 1 . 64 billion dlrs .
Bally acquired Six Flags for 147 . 4 mln dlrs in January 1982 from Penn Central Corp . Bally bought the Great America theme park in Gurnee , Ill ., in May 1984 for 113 . 2 mln dlrs from Marriott Corp & lt ; mhs >.
In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48 . 6 mln dlrs on revenues of 369 . 4 mln dlrs .
The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating profit of 60 . 4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475 . 6 mln dlrs in 1986 , of which 456 . 2 mln came from the clubs .
The company earlier this month said it will take a charge to earnings in the first quarter of 17 . 3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2 . 6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump .
Under a February 21 deal , Bally agreed to buy the 2 . 6 mln of the 3 . 06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share , or 62 . 4 mln dlrs , plus 6 . 2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years .
The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump ' s remaining shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach that level by February 21 , 1988 .
FRANKLIN RESOURCES & lt ; BEN > SAYS NET MAY DOUBLE Franklin Resources Inc said it believes earnings could double this year as compared to a year ago when the company reported income of 32 mln dlrs on 143 mln dlrs in revenues .
Franklin Resources is a financial services company .
Its fiscal year ends September 30 .
CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR Cuban sugar export figures for January suggest that this year ' s crop may be at least as large as last year ' s 7 . 35 mln tonnes , according to sugar analysts .
Exports in January totalled 733 , 000 tonnes raw value , up from 725 , 000 a year earlier , according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization .
January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop , they said .
Fourth quarter exports fell to 622 , 000 tonnes from 909 , 000 tonnes a year earlier , but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985 , they added .
Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this year at 7 . 50 mln tonnes .
Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12 , 000 tonnes , giving a final 1985 / 86 crop total of 7 . 35 mln tonnes , compared with a 1984 / 85 crop of 8 . 10 mln tonnes .
There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba , but a hurricane meant that last year ' s crop was extended .
Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362 , 000 tonnes from 489 , 000 in January 1986 , but other Comecon countries received 210 , 000 tonnes , against 80 , 000 tonnes in the same month last year , figures received by the ISO show .
Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar .
Cuba ' s November 1986 exports totalled 158 , 000 tonnes , compared with 190 , 000 tonnes in 1985 , and December ' s total was 237 , 000 tonnes , down from 518 , 000 tonnes the year before .
Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6 . 69 mln tonnes against 7 . 21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980 ' s 6 . 19 mln tonnes , the figures show .

U . S . CONSERVATION SIGNUP SEEN 10 TO 12 MLN ACRES Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign - up in the USDA ' s conservation reserve program , scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today .
The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted , they said .
Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8 . 9 mln acres , so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week .
However , some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign - up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices , citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers .
Also , acres set - aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding , so the impact on total corn production will be minimal , they added .

CYCLOPS & lt ; CYL > WILL NOT GIVE DATA TO GROUP Cyclops Corp said its board rejected a request by Cyacq Corp , an investor group , for more non - public information about Cyclops , a maker of specialty steels and an electronics retailer .
Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britain ' s Dixons Group PLC for 90 . 25 dlrs a share under a tender offer that expires midnight March 17 .
Cyacq , comprising Audio / Video Affiliates Inc , Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd and other investors , yesterday said it would increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92 . 50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs , subject to certain conditions .
The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with non - public data given to Dixons and that Cyacq be satisfied with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer .
Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq ' s announcement was not an offer .
" Cyacq ' s press release does not amend Cyacq ' s outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing commitments necessary to carry out its original offer or any increased offer that it may make ," Cyclops said in a statement .
Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated it will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts , Cyclops said .
The company also said it was advised that Dixons ' shareholders approved the merger , satisfying that condition of the agreement .

USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN - U . S . REPORT The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October , purchasing close to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in the 1986 / 87 marketing year , according to a report from the U . S . agriculture counselor in Belgrade .
Approximately 1 . 5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986 / 87 , with most of this sold to the Soviet Union , the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U . S . official .
In a report dated March 10 , the official said that about 800 , 000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered , with the balance of 700 , 000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June .
An additional 500 , 000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July - September , the grain associaiton said , so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2 . 0 mln tonnes , the counselor said .
Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union , the counselor said .
Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160 , 000 tonnes since October 1 , higher than earlier estimates of 150 , 000 , the official said .
The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year , he said .

U . S . MAKES CONCILIATORY MOVE AT RUBBER PACT TALKS The U . S . Has dropped its insistence that the floor price in a new International Natural Rubber Agreement , INRA , be revised downward under certain circumstances , conference sources said .
The surprise conciliatory move by the U . S .
Meets one of the producers ' main concerns -- that the floor price , or " lower indicative price ," remain unchanged , they said .
It is not clear , however , whether all consuming countries will follow suit , as a number of them , in particular Britain , West Germany and Belgium , appeared to have strong reservations , the sources added .
The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of the " lower indicative price " ( set at 150 Malaysian / Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact ) if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , rises to 450 , 000 tonnes .
The sources said the question of to what extent price adjustments should be automatic remains a problem .
Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has been holding consultations with producers and consumers throughout the day .
The consumers ' group is now holding a separate meeting ahead of further consultations within the " president ' s group " tonight .
FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U . S . FEBRUARY ECONOMY U . S . February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy , economists said .
" If you ' re the Fed , there ' s no reason to do anything ," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc . " There are hints that GNP is picking up .
On the inflation front , all is well ," he said .
" Money supply is well under control .
It ' s an absolutely ideal situation .
" February U . S . industrial production rose 0 . 5 pct , slightly less than the 0 . 7 pct gain the financial markets had expected .
This compared with a slim 0 . 1 pct rise in January ' s production number , previously reported as a 0 . 4 pct increase .
The February U . S . producer price index gained only 0 . 1 pct , less than a 0 . 3 - 0 . 4 pct expected rise .
This followed a 0 . 6 pct rise in the PPI in January .
" The Fed is going to look at this positively ," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation .
" Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker ( Fed Chairman ) has said lately .
Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants .
" The energy products component of PPI rose 4 . 0 pct in February , after a 9 . 8 pct increase in January .
" This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel ," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . " The trend is still 3 . 5 pct in the first half of the year .
" In 1986 , declining energy prices contributed to a 2 . 5 pct decline in the PPI .
Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected , but a sharp drop in auto prices was not .
Passenger car prices fell 3 . 4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1 . 3 pct .
Yesterday , Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve .
" The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today ," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International .
While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy , Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar .
" The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air ," he said .
" We need inflation for U . S . producers to compete with foreign producers .
" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0 . 8 pct in February ' s PPI .
With many electronic goods produced overseas , this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U . S . competitiveness , he said .
If further dollar declines are needed , this could diminish overseas investment in U . S . debt , Brusca added , which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices .
By contrast , Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11 . 8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade - weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 .
Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers ' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire , and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar .
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8 . 5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 , which has contributed to rising U . S . industrial output .
" It ' s the other side of the lower dollar ," Wyss said .
" Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output .
" Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0 . 3 - 0 . 4 pct in the first quarter .
" It ' s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive .
" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains .
He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output .
Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production .
Utilities output rose 0 . 7 pct in February after gaining 1 . 2 pct in January , but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced , not that manufacturing activity gained .
Finally , he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8 . 3 million units at an annual rate from 7 . 5 million units .
" In the first quarter , it looks like automakers are producing at an 8 . 5 mln unit annual rate , but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate ," Roach said .
" The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories .
" Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U . S . business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 .
January business inventories rose 0 . 9 pct , the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1 . 7 pct , the Commerce Department said .
Business sales dropped 4 . 5 pct in January , the largest monthly sales drop on record .
Nonetheless , economists do not expect the Fed to react to month - to - month changes .
" The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months ," Ramirez said .
" They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months .
"
MOBIL & lt ; MOB > CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOWER IN 1987 Mobil Corp chairman Allen E . Murray said in the annual report issued today that the company ' s total 1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three billion dlrs spent in 1986 .
" Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall slightly below the level for 1986 although we ' ll be ready to increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising ," Murray said .
Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984 ' s 3 . 6 billion dlrs to 3 . 5 billion dlrs in 1985 .
Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts " the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U . S ., Canada , Europe , Africa and Indonesia .
Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units , which support the new affiliate .
" Mobil ' s chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets ," said John Lord , a Mobil Corp spokesman .
Murray said in announcing the first reorganization , which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization , Mobil Exploration and Production U . S . Inc , that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company ' s upstream competitive position .
Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc , MEPSI , to enhance the development and transfer of technology supporting critical areas of exploration , drilling , resevoir management and computer systems .
Earnings from Mobil ' s upstream operations in 1986 were 827 mln dlrs , down 54 pct from the previous year ' s 1 . 8 billion dlrs in earnings .
Mobil ' s strategy in the exploration and production sector will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities with the greatest long term potential , the company said .
In its annual report , Mobil said that this will include greater emphasis on " frontier plays that , although riskier , fit our strengths of technology and size ... This probably also means a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective overseas exploration offers greater potential .

BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES Brazil ' s labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country ' s main oil installations occupied three days ago .
The troops went in at the request of the state - oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55 , 000 oil industry employees .
Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops .
The situation in the refineries was calm , it said , and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal .
A national seamen ' s strike , however , continued and marines remained in the country ' s main ports .
The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen ' s strike , now two weeks old , was ruled illegal last Friday .
A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike - bound , 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports .
Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals , Global and Flumar , struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase .
Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end .
Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil ' s 40 , 000 seamen were still on strike .
The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding .
Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday .
Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator .
Besides industrial troubles , there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector .
On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates .
Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today , with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana .
The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance .
On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks .
Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange .

REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM & lt ; VIA > OFFER Investor Sumner Redstone , who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc , offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1 . 50 dlrs a share cash and 1 . 50 dlrs in securities .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Redstone , who controls Dedham , Mass .,- based National Amusements Inc , a theater chain operator , offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40 . 50 dlrs .
Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7 . 50 dlrs from six dlrs .
The Redstone offer , which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc , a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose , which also give Viacom shareholders one - fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover .
Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc , a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom .
The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers , but said a special committee of its board would review them later today .
The Redstone group , which has a 19 . 5 pct stake in Viacom , and the management group , which has a 5 . 4 pct stake , have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed , unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock .
The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements , which give them access to Viacom ' s financial records provided they keep the information secret .
In his SEC filing , Redstone , who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2 . 95 billion dlrs , said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2 . 275 billion dlrs .
Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate , Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs , Redstone said .
Merrill Lynch , Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover , from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier , Redstone said .
Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover .
The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group ' s 6 , 881 , 800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash , he said .
The new offer , the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month - long bidding war with management , also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents , he said .
Last week , the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company , valued at 3 . 1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38 . 50 dlrs a share cash , preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company .
Redstone ' s previous offer had been valued at 3 . 2 billion dlrs .

ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA Construction workers today began building a 26 km ( 16 mile ) pipeline to link Ecuador ' s jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast , Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said .
They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon , Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline , which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia ' s Pacific Ocean coast .
The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 barrels of day ( bpd ) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline , they said .
The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude , they said .
It is currently transporting about 17 , 000 bpd out of its 100 , 000 bpd capacity , an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said .
The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand .
The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production , paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before .
The tremor ruptured the country ' s main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao , on the Pacific Ocean .
Ecuador was pumping about 260 , 000 bpd before the earthquake .
It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao , government officials said .
Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake , energy ministry Javier Espinosa said .
DUTCH TRADE FULLY IN BALANCE BUT DOWN IN JANUARY The Netherlands recorded a flat trade balance in January , with both exports and imports totaling 14 . 2 billion guilders , a modestly lower compared with December but sharply down from January last year , an Economics Ministry spokesman said , quoting official statistics .

January 1986 imports compared with 15 . 3 billion guilders in December and fell 18 pct from 17 . 4 billion in January last year .
NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need , competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U . S . corn , industry and government officials said .
As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1 . 5 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U . S . corn likely .
First , there are supply concerns .
Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year ' s Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes , rather than the 210 mln announced , therby increasing the Soviet need for grain .
A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying , an Agriculture Department source said .
Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986 / 87 corn crop estimate this week to 11 . 0 mln tonnes , down from 11 . 5 mln .
Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500 , 000 tonnes to 6 . 8 mln tonnes .
Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year ' s corn for export , a USDA official said , with two mln tonnes of that booked for April - June delivery to the USSR .
" Significant downside potential " still exists for the Argentine crop , the official said , which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow .
" If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking , then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period ," he said .
Current competitive prices for U . S . corn have also sparked Soviet buying .
U . S . corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne , Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread , U . S . and Soviet sources said .
" This price difference makes American corn competitive ," Albert Melnikov , commercial counselor for the Soviet Union , told Reuters .
Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise , and with the recently strong U . S . corn futures prices , the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy , sources said .
Finally , some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U . S ./ USSR grains agreement ( four mln tonnes ), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat .
In an inteview with Reuters this week , USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer , but that such an offer had not been ruled out .

TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS French operators last Friday requested licences to export 10 , 500 tonnes of free market maize , 11 , 950 tonnes of free market barley and 13 , 000 of soft wheat flour to non - EC countries , at prefixed daily ( droit commun ) rebates , French trade sources said .
The latest requests for the maize were for export to Switzerland , Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate .
The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500 , 000 tonnes of French maize to non - EC countries , in compensation for concessions to the U . S . in the recent dispute over grain sales to Spain .
If the latest French requests are accepted as expected , this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25 , 500 tonnes .
The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15 , 000 tonnes of free market maize to non - EC countries .
Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland , Austria and Lichtenstein , Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre - fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne , while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non - EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne .

STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U . S . OIL RESERVES A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry .
U . S . policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels , from its present 500 mln , to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise .
The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies , a private group , also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques .
It predicted prices would remain at about 15 - 18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s , with imports at about 30 pct of U . S . consumption .
The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation : to protect the U . S . industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil .
But the group did not strongly back either option , saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both .
It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports .

CBT TRADERS SAY U . S . CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL The 11 , 254 , 837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U . S . Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10 - 12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday , grain traders said .
Farmers enrolled 1 , 894 , 764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA , which may underpin new crop futures , they said .
New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign - up in the program .
But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set - aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures , since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land .
Of a total 11 , 254 , 837 erodoble acres submitted , usda accepted 10 , 572 , 402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 51 . 17 dlrs per acre .

CARBIDE & lt ; UK > LOOKS TO ACQUISITIONS FOR GROWTH Union Carbide Corp is looking to acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and plastics growth , according the H . W .
Lichtenberger , president of Chemicals and Plastics .
Describing this as a major departure in the company ' s approach to commercial development , he told the annual new business forum of the Commercial Development Association " We are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth markets we ' ve identified .
" Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude " that if we couldn ' t do it ourselves , it wasn ' t worth doing .
Or , if it was worth doing , we had to go it alone ," Lichtenberger explained .
He said " there are times when exploiting a profitable market is done best with a partner .
Nor do we see any need to plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link up profitably with someone who is already there .
" He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the same way .

TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U . S . agricultural goods and to modify some U . S . agricultural trade laws .
The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U . S . agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries .
The bill would allow U . S . agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge .
The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved .
In investigations involving a processed agricultural product , trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties .
The bill sets out U . S . trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
It would seek fair trade in agriculture , seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices , to eliminate tariffs , subsidies , quotas and non - tariff barriers .
President Reagan ' s authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3 , 1991 .
The bill extends Reagan ' s authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31 , 1989 .

The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1 , 1991 .
Presently , to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years .
Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports .

AFTER G - 6 , ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market ' s first test of the industrialized nations ' recent pact to stabilize currencies , analysts said .
In active trading this week , the market pushed the dollar , sterling , the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher .
But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure .
" So far G - 6 has been a roaring success ," said James O ' Neill , financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA .
" The central banks are sending strong signals that they won ' t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies ," added a senior corporate trader at one U . K . bank .
On February 22 , the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U . S ., Japan , West Germany , France and the U . K . -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada , signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels .
The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two - year decline against major world currencies .
And initially , traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower .
But by Wednesday , the dollar climbed to more than 1 . 87 marks , about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G - 6 accord .
The move was aided by indications that the U . S . economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing .
But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G - 6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines .
Dealers differed as to whether the U . S . central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1 . 87 marks , or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions .
But the dollar quickly backed off .
It hovered today around 1 . 85 marks .
" The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon ," said Marine Midland NA ' s O ' Neill .
Also on Wednesday , London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U . K . currency rose to 1 . 60 dlrs compared with 1 . 5355 dlrs before the G - 6 pact .
Sterling , along with the other high - yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar , was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar / mark and dollar / yen .
The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U . K . economy , anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election .
" There was a real run on sterling ," said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . Sterling traded today around 1 . 5750 dlrs , down from 1 . 5870 dlrs last night .
It slid to 2 . 917 marks from 2 . 950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2 . 98 recently .
" There ' s been some heavy profit - taking on sterling / mark ahead of next Tuesday ' s U . K . budget ," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp . As speculators detected the presence of the U . S . and British central banks , they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars .
But here too they were stymied .
The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency ' s rise .
The Canadian dollar traded at 1 . 3218 / 23 per U . S . dollar today , down from 1 . 3185 / 90 yesterday .
And the Australian Reserve Bank , using the Fed as agent , sold Australian dollars in the U . S . yesterday , dealers said .
The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67 . 45 / 55 U . S . cents today from a high of 69 . 02 Thursday .
Analysts said the central banks ' moves to stifle sudden upward movement , leave the market uncertain about its next step .
Today , the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months .
The dollar fell to 152 . 35 / 40 yen from 153 . 35 / 40 last night .
Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling / short mark positions established lately .
" Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy , the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen ," a dealer at one U . K . bank said .
Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders , lower industrial output and slowing employment gains .
Moreover , the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas , for example in Australian financial instruments , repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 .
Noting that the dollar / yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U . S . trade deficit with Japan , analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar ' s downward scope against the Japanese currency .
In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January , the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28 .
On that day , the dollar fell as low as 150 . 40 yen .
" Sure , the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January .
But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes ," said McGroarty of Discount .
WEYERHAEUSER & lt ; WY > SEES HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS Weyerhaeuser Co said it should have significant increases in earnings in 1987 and 1988 should be another very good year .
Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276 . 7 mln dlrs , or 1 . 91 dlrs per share , on 5 . 65 billion dlrs in revenues .
Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to invest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in the past few years , Weyerhaeuser also said .
Weyerhaeuser , principally a lumber products company , said the forecast was made by the company ' s chief financial officer during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo .
It also said its expects to see opportunities in the building products area , particularly in composite panels and in other engineered products directed toward specific , rather than commodity , end - use markets .
But it said growth may be higher in added - value products , in financial services and in other diversified businesses .
In addition , the company said rising product prices and demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world markets , except in the case of some light - weighted paper grades where overcapacity remains a problem .
Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its manufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significant productivity increases .

Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures , but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly .
The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31 .
Indications of a heavy sign - up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63 . 0 to 67 . 0 mln acres from 67 . 0 to 69 . 0 mln .
Richard Loewy , analyst with Prudential Bache Securities , said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures .
" The 1 . 9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing ," he added .
The USDA later released the state - by - state breakdown of the enrollment figures .
Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans , and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures .
Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring , he said : " The trade was definitely looking higher , so certificates are going to be less than expected .
" The USDA offered a special corn " bonus " rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates .
The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel , based on the farm program payment yield for corn , for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve .
Katharina Zimmer , analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures , said the conservation sign - up was slightly higher than she had expected , although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures .
" I think it is friendly for the market , at least in the long run ," she said .
Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign - up or the latest addition .
" It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program ," she said .
Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign - up .
She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres , she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60 ' s .
Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres .
New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign - up in the program , despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures .

U . S . SAYS CANADA COMPLYING WITH LUMBER PACT The Commerce Department said that all Canadian firms had begun to pay an agreed to 15 pct surcharge on softwood shipped to U . S . markets .
It made the statement after talks with Canadian officials about press reports and speculation in Canada that some exporters were not paying the charge .

Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said " We are gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying the export charge on lumber .
" He added the agreement was important to the health of the U . S . lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully carried out .

The new company will be directed by a six - member board , with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific .
According to PDVSA , Venezuelans will occupy such key positions such as treasurer and vice - president for manufacturing .
The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160 , 000 bpd of crudes and another 40 , 000 bpd of intermediates .
The plant will be able to handle 110 , 000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes , which make up more than half of the country ' s crude oil exports .

VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12 . 5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12 . 5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand , Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement .
Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake .
Venezuela would lend 50 , 000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7 . 5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments , Espinosa said .
Also , Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador , he said .
Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao , a task that would take an estimated five months .
Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand .
Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired .
Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ).
Ecuador was exporting about 140 , 000 bpd before the earthquake , Energy Ministry officials said .
Its total output was around 260 , 000 bpd .

TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES U . S . economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U . S . interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3 - 1 / 2 months , financial analysts said .
" People don ' t seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything ," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains .
The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume , he noted .
" We ' ve had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people ' s viewpoints on interest rates ," Mains said .
The data , which has provided not clear - cut view of the economy , coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for " less than ebullient market action ," Mains said .
He added , however , that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range .
" My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified ," Mains said .
Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest .
" All of the movement occurs at the opening ," afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades , Connery said .
Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices , the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were " not real exciting ," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner .
" There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment ," Leiner said .
Next week ' s revision to fourth quarter U . S .
Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market , said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan .
Still , forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month .
Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct , due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday , which showed the largest increase since 1979 .
" The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP , but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal ," Kahan said .
He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth .
If that is the case , GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate , Kahan said .

NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIED - COLOMBIA OFFICIAL A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld , Gilberto Arango , president of the private exporters ' association , told Reuters .
Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may , with the National Coffee Growers ' Federation setting no limit .
Since the start of the coffee year last october , private exporters were on average allowed 350 , 000 bags of 60 kilos per month .
" Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales .
Even today it pressured the market .
But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top ," Arango said in an interview .
" Colombia ' s marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently .
No targets for volume will be set .
We will react to market factors adequately .
Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away ," he added .
Arango described measures adopted here yesterday , including a lower export registration price , as a major change in Colombia ' s coffee marketing policy .
The export registration price , or reintegro , was lowered to 1 . 10 dlr per lb ex - dock new york , or 155 . 83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos , from 1 . 35 dlrs ( 194 . 33 dlrs ).
The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro , in order to closely reflect market trends , which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market .
A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur , he said .
GENEVA - negotiators at U . N . Conference agree basic elements in new rubber pact - chairman
GENEVA - negotiators at U . N . Conference agree basic elements in new rubber pact - chairman
MAJOR DIFFERENCES RESOLVED AT RUBBER PACT TALKS Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact , conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said .
" We have resolved major differences of opinion ," he told Reuters .
Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord , to replace the current one which expires in October .
Xuto said : " I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption " since the talks began last Monday .
" It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement ," he added .
The renegotiation conference , under the auspices of the U . N . Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ), is the fourth such meeting in two years .
Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points : 1 ) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months .
Previously consumers were proposing 12 - month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact .
2 ) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below ( or above ) the lower intervention price ( or the upper intervention price ), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards ( or upwards ) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage .
If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300 , 000 tonnes , the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage .
3 ) If the buffer stock reaches 400 , 000 tonnes , the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150 , 000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian / Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents .
4 ) The floor price will not be breached .
Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , rose to 450 , 000 tonnes .
The proposal , initiated by the U . S ., Was withdrawn last night , setting the stage for compromise .
Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20 .
The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal .
Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five - year pact had failed , the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock .
The United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Italy and Britain are the major consumers .
UNCTAD ' s latest estimates project an increase of 8 . 5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4 . 1 pct in 1988 .

ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY PROGRAM Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last week ' s earthquake which killed at least 300 people .
Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct , government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials , including the president and cabinet , would be reduced .

YUGOSLAVIAN OIL FIRM STARTS WORKING WITH FRENCH Yugoslavia ' s top oil and natural gas producer & lt ; Ina - Naftaplin > has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern & lt ; Petro Chemie >, the official Tanjug news agency said .
Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical , chemical , textile and plastics industries .
The Yugoslav firms , in turn , will export oil products to France .
Tanjug said this year ' s exchange will value 530 mln dlrs .
Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany ' s Hoechst AG & lt ; HFAG . F > two years ago .
Ina also has joint ventures and co - production projects , involving Yugoslavia ' s other main producer & lt ; Naftagas > of Novi Sad , with partners in Angola , Algeria and Tunisia , exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas .
An estimated 300 , 000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years , Tanjug said .
Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia ' s total oil production , which amounts to 4 . 2 mln tonnes a year .
Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia ' s leading export enterprises .
In a separate statement issued through Tanjug , Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3 , 000 meters in the Bay of Baes , in Tunisia .
Ina is jointly prospecting with the U . S . Firm Conoco for oil and gas there .
Work on a second drill , below 4 , 000 meters , would start soon in the Bay of Gabes , the statement said .

IRAN HAS ANTI - SHIP MISSILES NEAR GULF - PAPER Iran has deployed about six large missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to shipping in the Gulf , the New York Times said .
The paper quoted U . S . Intelligence sources as saying the missiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY - 2 which is based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile .
Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles .
It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz .
Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit , the paper said .
None of the new missiles had been fired yet , it added .
The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had installed new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had warned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping .
BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month , compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government ' s anti - inflation plan .
At a rally in this city , about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo , about 5 , 000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met .
Wilson Gomes de Moura , president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees ' 152 unions representing 700 , 000 workers , told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks .
The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55 , 000 oil workers threatened action against the state - owned petroleum company Petrobras .
The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation , but the troops were removed yesterday .
Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday .
The government has also sent marines into the main ports .
A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise .
Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work , as have about 5 , 000 seamen employed by Petrobras .
Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks .
According to official estimates , prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year .
CANADA RULING ON U . S . CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U . S . corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers , U . S . government and farm group representatives said .
The deadline for a final determination is March 7 .
U . S . officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports .
In that case , Canada decided pasta imports , which take about ten pct of the Canadian market , did not injure domestic producers .
U . S . corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market .
Canada slapped a 1 . 05 dlrs per bushel duty on U . S . corn imports in November 1986 , but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U . S . subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated .
BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war .
" The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I ' ve ever seen it in six years in Washington ," Baldrige said in a television interview .
" I think we ' ll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration , but there is a hardening trade attitude ," he said .
President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation , but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation .
However , Baldrige warned measures that would penalise trading partners such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U . S . Could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill .
When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war , Baldrige said : " Yes , I don ' t think there ' s any question about that .

SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE JUNE 25
SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE JUNE 25
SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC ' s December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it .
Nazer , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews , said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil , well below its OPEC quota .
Saudi Arabia , the world ' s largest oil exporter , will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact , Nazer said .
The 13 - nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7 . 25 pct to 15 . 8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1 .
Nazer , in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October , said : " I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our ( next OPEC ) meeting will take place as scheduled .
" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15 . 8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements .
" We ' ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified ," he said .
OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13 - year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact .
Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline .
Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4 . 133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price .
" As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December , Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement ," he said .
Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait , but not sales from floating storage , Nazer said .
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11 , said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non - OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC .
" Saudi Arabia doesn ' t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability ," he said .
Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of " swing producer " within OPEC .
Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over - production by some OPEC states .
" Saudi Arabia is not playing that role .
It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15 . 8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC ," Nazer said .
Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16 . 6 mln bpd .
But he said if circumstances changed " I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures .
" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer .
Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non - OPEC producers .
Norway , Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC ' s behalf earlier this year .
" We did not ask any country to do anything .
These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions ," Nazer said .
He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit .
IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT COCOA TALKS A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country ' s backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week .
The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks , convened by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ), in London on Monday .
While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet - Boigny , scheduled to be held in the country ' s capital Yamoussoukro between March 19 - 22 , senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks , the official said .
Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday .
The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact , which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world ' s cocoa exporters and consumers .
He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks , scheduled to end on March 27 .
The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact ' s buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses .
Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices .
TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS Tense trade relations with the U . S . And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community ( EC ) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow .
EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission ' s proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations .
The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package , due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month , of the EC ' s Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC ' s persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners .
The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production , rather than a straight forward tax .
They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output , but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units , over two billion dlrs , in farm costs .
It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters , led by the United States .
The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world , ranging from Senegal , Malaysia and Indonesia , to Brazil , Argentina , Canada , Iceland and Norway .
The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments , with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain , and Denmark , the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom .
Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy , France and Greece , which backed similar proposals in the past , did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected .
But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U . S . And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti - EC action , and the foreign ministers ' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument .
The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U . S . Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports .
The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill , if enacted , would provoke swift EC retaliation .
FIRST MISSISSIPPI CORP & lt ; FRM > SETS PAYOUT Qtly div six cts vs six cts prior Pay April 28 Record March 31
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom ' s oil - dependent economy .
The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices .
The four - day conference in this resort town , high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea , has been organised by Saudi Arabia ' s chambers of commerce .
Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal - Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al - Salim will attend the first day .
Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year ' s slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance .
Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia , the world ' s largest crude exporter , needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil - based economy .
The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans .
Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel .
With oil prices recovering , Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long - delayed budget plans incorporating a 52 . 7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves .
The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community .
Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November , while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non - performing loans .
But not all bankers are convinced .
One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said : " Banks are still reluctant to lend ...
There is certainly more optimism in the air , but I am not sure if it is firmly based .
" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non - oil economy may still be contracting .
Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply .
A U . S . Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said : " While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government ' s highest priorities , the recession , the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry .
" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here .
Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986 , compared with the same period in 1985 .
Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund , a major source of industry backing , has fallen steadily since 1983 .
Trading companies have also been hit , some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit .
Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories .
Others have effectively been liquidated .
A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments .
The latest rescheduling is for the shipping - to - hotels conglomerate REDEC .
Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1 . 3 billion riyals of bank debt .
Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U . S . And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom .
A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg .
CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS , HELPED BY AX Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year , continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses , president Jacques Calvet said .
Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model , he said : " All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987 , compared with 1986 ," he added .
Citroen , part of the private Peugeot SA & lt ; PEUP . PA > group , increased its share of the French new car market to 13 . 7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12 . 1 pct a year earlier .
It is aiming for an average 12 . 8 pct share throughout the year after 11 . 7 pct in 1986 .
The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market , excluding France , to 3 . 2 pct this year from 2 . 9 pct in 1986 .
" Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand ," Calvet said .
" This is a relatively new problem for us .
" Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985 , helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity .
Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen ' s 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs .
This weekend he said that those profit estimates " remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic .
" Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX , launched on the French market last October .
It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months .
The car has registered just over 20 , 000 sales .
It is being built at Citroen ' s large plant at Aulnay - sous - Bois in northern Paris , as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain , with production just reaching target level of 1 , 000 cars a day .
The car , which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long - running 2CV and the Visa , is designed to compete with the Renault 5 , Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa .
The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month .
Calvet said : " Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed , we will have between 6 . 5 and seven per cent of the national market .

NO TAIWAN SUGAR EXPORTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR Taiwan is not expected to export sugar this year because of falling production and growing domestic consumption , state - owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said .
A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar .
Last year , sugar exports totalled 149 , 755 tonnes .
He said the actual production during the 1986 / 87 season ( November / May ) is about 480 , 000 tonnes , barely enough to meet local consumption .
This compares with actual 1985 / 86 output of 570 , 000 .
He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage to more than 6 , 000 hectares of canefields last year .
LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability , but U . S . Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth .
The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month ' s talks seem likely to build on that stability .
A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm .
But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood , " That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels .
That is in fact what has happened since Paris .
" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short - term policy objectives .
Instead they have focused on medium - term policy goals , but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings .
The official refused to comment , however , on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year .
On February 22 , the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions , given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth .
The shake - up would strengthen the U . S .
Position in future international talks .
" I think these changes will strengthen the President ' s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora ," said the official , an Administration economic policymaker .
" So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives .
" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability .
Last week , dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark , which had breached 1 . 86 to the dollar .
British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling ' s strength .
International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers , who will review market performance and their own economic prospects , will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund .
The sources said Italy , which refused to join the Paris pact , was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker .
Since Paris , there are signs West German growth is slowing , while U . S . Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing .
Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank ( central bank ) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit .
A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany .
But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank .
" If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it , it would no longer be private ," said the official , who asked not to be identified .
Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged , but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U . S . Trade deficit remains stubbornly high , further coordinated action could be on the April agenda .
REUTER ...
HARPER AND ROW & lt ; HPR > TO MULL OPTIONS AFTER BIDS Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover bids that the company has received .
Instead , it appointed a committee of independent directors to study strategic alternatives for the 170 - year - old firm .
The alternatives include continuation of the company ' s existing business plans , possible business combinations , sales of stock , restructuring and the sale of all or part of the company .
Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on the alternatives , Harper and Row added .
Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a share for Harper and Row , prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a share from another publishing firm , Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc & lt ; HBJ >.
After considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday , the Harper and Row board decided not to act on them .
The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company ' s independence and take advantage of its " considerable future prospects ," according to director Winthrop Knowlton , former chief executive and now chairman of the newly established independent committee .
" However , given the significant current interest in the company , we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available .
The committee will consider all the pertinent facts and alternatives .... We intend to make a careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a conclusion ," Knowlton said .
Pending its deliberations , Harper and Row ' s board has postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to recapitalize the company ' s stock to create two classes of shares with different voting rights .
SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January , but major industries , including oil and machinery , are still short of production targets , official figures show .
Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0 . 8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year .
However , the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0 . 1 pct from a year earlier .
Production is targetted to increase 4 . 4 pct for all of 1987 .
The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February .
Production of oil , the country ' s main export to Western nations , hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February , up from 97 . 3 mln a year earlier , and exceeded its target by 0 . 5 pct .
Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983 .
Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141 . 6 billion in 1985 .
Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets were also not fulfilled , but did not give figures .
Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality controls imposed on enterprises .
Production in the machine - building sector , a priority in Moscow ' s plans for economic renewal , recovered slightly in February but was still 3 . 6 pct lower in the first two months of the year compared with the same period of 1986 .
The figures showed that five republics produced less than in the first two months of 1986 .
ROTTERDAM PORT UNION AND EMPLOYERS TO MEET Dutch port and transport union , FNV , agreed to an employers ' request to reconvene abandoned peace talks tonight to try to end strikes that have disrupted Rotterdam ' s general cargo sector for the past six weeks , a union spokesman said .
Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800 from the sector ' s 4 , 000 workforce , starting with 350 this year .
The employers ' invitation to restart the talks comes on the day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf for a resolution of the dispute expires .
De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the sector .
No comment was immediately available from the employers ' organization .
PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country ' s international reserves , a government decree in the Official Gazette said .
Under the system , importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange .
The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange .
Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1 . 54 billion dlrs a year ago .
The system will be effective until the end of 1988 .
A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank , the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes .
The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council .
Peru ' s reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1 . 1 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary central bank estimates .
Total exports dropped to 2 . 50 billion dlrs last year against 2 . 97 billion in 1985 .
Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8 . 5 pct , the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years .
Imports were about 2 . 49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1 . 87 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary estimates .
The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard - line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14 . 3 billion dlr foreign debt .
TAIWAN SAYS U . S .
WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE The United States wants Taiwan ' s currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan ' s trade surplus with the U . S ., A senior trade official said .
Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U . S . Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation .
Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U . S responded to Taiwan ' s request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May .
Taiwan ' s surplus with the U . S . Hit a record 13 . 6 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1986 .
Washington signed a three - year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0 . 5 pct a year .
Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U . S . Dollar since September 1985 .
It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value .
It rose four cents against the U . S . Dollar on Saturday to close at 34 . 59 .
Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U . S . Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise .
TANZANIA WANTS TO EXPORT 200 , 000 TONNES OF MAIZE Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200 , 000 tonnes of maize from last year ' s bumper harvest , agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday .
The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2 . 1 mln tonnes , but only a fraction of this was marketed , with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it .
The state - owned National Milling Corp ( NMC ) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190 , 742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country .
NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56 , 000 tonnes of silo storage capacity , concentrated in Dar es Salaam , Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania .
In addition , the country has 450 , 000 tonnes of flat storage capacity , he added .
Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of Iringa , Mbeya , Ruvuma and Rukwa .

AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SEEN NARROWING Australia ' s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs , from the unrevised January level of 1 . 29 billion , market economists polled by Reuters said .
Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow .
The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January , after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs .
As an example they quoted wheat export volume , which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January .
A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit , the economists said .
Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments , they said .
They said the Australian dollar , which last week touched an eight - month high of 0 . 6900 U . S . Dlrs but is now around the 0 . 6800 level , should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs .

ZAMBIA , IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia ' s talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies , an official newspaper said .
The Times of Zambia , which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party ( UNIP ), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them .
President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December , in line with IMF recommendations , but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed .
The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances , but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year .
The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government ' s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia ' s foreign exchange auction .
The central bank ' s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January , pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate .
The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system , losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months .
However , since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar .
Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12 . 50 kwacha per dollar on the currency ' s devaluation once the auctions restart .
According to the Times of Zambia , the IMF team , led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah , is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23 .
The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected .
JAPAN LINE SELLING TANKERS AND BULKERS Major tanker operator , Japan Line Ltd & lt ; JLIT . T >, is selling 20 VLCCs and several bulk carriers for scrap or further trading , industry sources said .
The tanker disposals include Japan Orchid ( 231 , 722 dwt ), Japan Lupinus ( 233 , 641 dwt ), Sovereign ( 233 , 313 dwt ), Rosebay ( 274 , 531 dwt ), Saffron ( 268 , 038 dwt ) and Cattleya ( 267 , 807 dwt ), all of which have been reported on the London sale and purchase market , they said , but refused to give further details .
Japan Line officials declined to comment .
( CORRECTED )- IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT TALKS A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country ' s backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week .
The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks , convened by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ), in London on Monday .

TREASURY , FOREIGN RESERVES ARE JORDAN ' S PRIORITIES Jordan ' s key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves , Prime Minister Zeid al - Rifa ' i said .
" First , the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved ," he said in a television interview Saturday .
" The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide ( the ) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments .
" Rifa ' i said Jordan ' s outstanding government - guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14 . 9 pct .
The figure was sharply lower than the 1 . 02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September , according to latest Central Bank figures .
Rifa ' i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar , which is pegged to a basket of currencies , is overvalued .
" The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability ," he said .
The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan .
Under a 10 - year agreement reached in 1978 , Jordan was to receive a total of 1 . 25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel .
But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations , while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices .
LANGE PREDICTS N . Z .
INFLATION TO FALL TO 8 - 10 PCT New Zealand ' s inflation rate could fall to eight pct in the coming year , Prime Minister David Lange said .
He said forecasts to be released soon by research groups would predict a rate of around eight or nine pct in the 12 months to the end of March 1988 , against 18 . 2 pct in calendar 1986 .
" I predict it will be something between eight and 10 per cent ," he told a news conference .
Lange would not name the forecasting groups .
MALAYSIA WELCOMES ACCORD ON NEW RUBBER PACT Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik welcomed the basic accord reached over the weekend in Geneva between producers and consumers on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ).
" This is a good development and if a new pact is adopted this week it will augur well for the rubber industry and prices in the long term ," he told Reuters here .
Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new INRA resolved differences and agreed last Saturday on basic elements for a new pact to replace the current one , which expires in October .
Conference Chairman Manaspas Xuto said legal drafting of the new pact will begin this week and it is expected to be formally adopted by some 40 countries on March 20 .
Malaysia , the world ' s top producer , acted as spokesman for producers at the talks , which began on March 9 .
Malaysian traders said they expected prices to firm by a few cents on the news that a pact is expected to be adopted .
Prices will also firm in the short term because some 370 , 000 tonnes of rubber held in INRA buffer stock will not be liquidated with a new pact in sight , they said .

GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks ' off - balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments , banking sources said .
Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny , and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U . S . And U . K . To Japan .
Juergen Becker , director of the Bundesbank ' s division of banking law and credit supervision , said the U . S .- British proposals were interesting , but declined to elaborate .
But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals .
" There is no formal plan yet , but talks are in the latter stages ," one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said .
Bankers expect rule changes this year .
All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank , West Germany ' s four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office .
Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany ' s credit law , which has been in effect since 1934 .
Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it , banking sources said .
Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks ' lending to 18 times shareholders ' equity plus reserves , on a consolidated basis .
But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts , currency and interest swaps , commercial paper programs , currency options , interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges .
The sources said the main value of the U . S .- U . K . Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor , and , for instance , in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps .
But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps , they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk .
U . S .- British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps , whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary , especially when counterparties remain anonymous .
This is the so - called market - to - market value .
But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved , the sources said .
The weightings , also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks ' securities portfolios , are zero for public authorities , 20 pct for domestic banks , 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non - bank borrowers .
A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U . S . And the U . K . May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage , the sources said .
Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U . S .- U . K . Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U . S . And British authorities , the sources said .
One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long - dated foreign exchange forward transaction could , for instance , be brought under the same rule as a cross - currency swap , despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different .
How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain .
Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead - manage mark eurobonds .
But as their equity capital is fairly small , tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks ' freedom of movement , particularly in the growing business of currency swaps , if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet , the sources added .

GERMAN RETAIL TURNOVER RISES ONE PCT IN JANUARY West German retail turnover rose a real one pct in January compared with the same month a year earlier , according to provisional data from the Federal Statistics Office .
There were 26 shopping days in January this year , the same as in January 1986 , a Statistics Office statement said .
A Statistics Office official added retail turnover had risen by 7 . 6 pct in December compared with the year - ago month , a slight upward revision from the 7 . 5 pct increase provisionally posted .
BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range , a senior central bank official told reporters .
He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions , a dollar fall or a dollar rise .
Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability , but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks , he said .
The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time , the senior bank official said , but declined to be more specific .
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar / yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy .
Asked what factors might destabilize the markets , the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention , a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan , the U . S . Or West Germany , or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down .
The senior bank official said he expects Japan ' s gross national product ( GNP ) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April .
That would be little changed from the performance expected this year .
Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987 / 88 , but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point , he said .
He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy .
The economy ' s performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy , he added .
The central bank ' s monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy , the senior bank official said .
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half .
Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation , there could be some problems in the future , he said .
" We are sitting on a barrel of powder , but fortunately it may still be wet ," he added .
Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially , he said .
The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices , the bank official said .
This inflow of funds into the stock exchange , occurring also in other countries , may continue , he said .
The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re - appointed when his current term expires later this year .
" He ' s a great man ," the official said , adding that more and more people expect his reappointment .
Turning to exchange rates , the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade , even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through .
Even the U . S . Trade position has begun to feel the impact , although so far it has not been very strong , he said .
BANGLADESH MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN DECEMBER Bangladesh ' s broad - based M2 money supply rose 6 . 95 pct to 132 . 79 billion taka in December after rising 0 . 51 pct to 124 . 16 billion in November and 3 . 07 pct to 114 . 22 billion in December 1985 , the Central Bank said .

JIM WALTER CORP & lt ; JWC > SETS PAYOUT Qtly div 35 cts vs 35 cts prior Pay April One Record March 14
JAPAN BUSINESS DECLINE SEEN BOTTOMING OUT The extended decline in Japan ' s overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January - March quarter , the Finance Ministry said .
Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic , it said after carrying out a quarterly survey .
The survey , conducted in February , was based on questionnaires returned by 8 , 328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries .
The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 0 . 4 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 5 . 4 pct decrease in the first half .
Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987 , rising an estimated 10 . 7 pct , it added .
Manufacturers ' earnings , hit hard by the yen ' s steady rise against the dollar , will rise 7 . 7 pct in first - half fiscal 1987 after falling 10 . 7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 , it said .
Overall earnings of non - manufacturing companies will rise 11 . 8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 9 . 8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 , the survey said .
It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen ' s appreciation .
CARLTON BUYS STAKE IN CENTRAL INDEPENDENT TV Carlton Communications Plc & lt ; CCML . L > said in a statement it had purchased a 20 pct stake or some 5 . 1 mln shares in Central Independent Television from Ladbroke Group Plc & lt ; LADB . L > at 578p per share .
The consideration of 29 . 5 mln stg will be met with 18 . 2 mln stg in cash and the issue of one million ordinary Carlton shares , it said .
Central showed pretax profits up by 57 pct to 18 . 8 mln stg for the year ended 30 September 1986 .
EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year , despite recent firmness in world prices , analysts and industry sources said .
A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while , so far , European Community ( EC ) growers plan unchanged to lower areas , increases are expected in some Eastern European nations .
Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F . O . Licht .
Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this .
In recent years , good autumn weather has given yields a late boost , making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons .
Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so - called " C " sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market .
This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC " A " and " B " quotas , which receive full and partial price support , respectively .
Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output .
Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices .
However , with the EC budget stretched to breaking point , this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic " A " and " B " quotas , they added .
In France , the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar , the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year ' s 421 , 000 hectares , nine pct below the previous year .
" The basic trend is towards stability ," a FIRS spokesman said .
Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars , white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels , he said .
Beet sugar output last year was 3 . 37 mln tonnes , with an average yield of 8 . 00 tonnes per ha , the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8 . 52 the previous year and a five year average 8 . 11 .
In West Germany , recent price rises have not altered plans , since planting decisions were taken a few months ago , industry sources said .
The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average .
Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385 , 000 hectares against 399 , 000 last year .
British Sugar Plc , the monopoly beet processor , has signed up U . K .
Farmers to grow 8 . 1 mln tonnes of beet .
This should yield about 1 . 25 mln tonnes of whites .
Last year ' s crop equalled the second highest ever at 1 . 32 mln tonnes .
British Sugar has " A " and " B " quotas totalling 1 . 144 mln tonnes of whites and its " C " output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease - resistant seed types .
Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans , Wincenty Nowicki , a deputy director of Cukropol , the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises , said .
World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level .
The national plan , set before prices began to rise , put plantings this year at 460 , 000 hectares , against 425 , 000 in 1986 , Nowicki said .
Last year production was 1 . 74 mln tonnes .
World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market , an official at the national beet growers ' association said .
Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year ' s 270 , 000 ha , especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya .
Beet output last season of 15 . 5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1 . 72 mln tonnes of white sugar .
Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130 , 000 ha from a record 137 , 600 in 1986 as a new self - imposed quota system comes into force , a spokesman for Centrale Suiker , the second largest Dutch sugar processor , said .
The new system aims for an average of around 915 , 000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of " C " sugar .
Last year , the Netherlands produced a record 1 . 2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined " A " and " B " quota of only 872 , 000 tonnes .
" The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of " C " sugar really worthwhile ," the spokesman said .
Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged .
Licht put this year ' s Soviet beet area at 3 . 40 mln ha , against 3 . 44 mln last year .
Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105 , 000 ha from some 95 , 000 in 1986 , the official MTI news agency said , but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand .
The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180 , 000 ha this year .
A spokesman for Denmark ' s largest beet concern , De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A / S , said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365 , 000 tonnes from a steady area of 60 , 000 ha .
In Sweden , where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand , the planted area is seen little changed at 51 , 000 ha against 51 , 300 last year , according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB .
Last year , Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state - run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36 , 400 hectares , down from 37 , 600 in 1986 .
SWISS UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS TO 0 . 9 PCT IN FEBRUARY Swiss unemployment edged down to 0 . 9 pct of the working population from one pct in January and in February 1986 , the Federal Office of Industry , Trade and Labour said .

The number of vacant positions registered with employment offices stood at 11 , 968 against 10 , 694 in January .
MALAYSIA ' S GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES RISE Malaysia ' s gold and foreign exchange reserves rose to 16 . 07 billion ringgit in February from 15 . 73 billion in January and 12 . 23 billion in February 1986 , Bank Negara Malaysia said .

BOND DEFERS RIGHTS ISSUE , MULLS PROJECT PARTNERS & lt ; Bond Corp International Ltd >, a subsidiary of the Australian - based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd & lt ; BONA . S >, said it would defer its planned rights issue but still wants the issue to be made before July 31 .
No date has been set for the issue , announced in January .

Bond International also said in the document that while it plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the HK - TVB shares as a long - term investment .
PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT Philippine government revenue is expected to rise 26 pct to 99 . 9 billion pesos this year from 79 . 1 billion in 1986 , Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said .
In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department ' s performance during the year ended February 28 , Ongpin said at least 15 . 9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year .
He said the goal for official development assistance ( ODA ) this year is two billion dlrs , adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1 . 7 billion dlrs in 1987 , up 30 pct from 1 . 3 billion in 1986 .
Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax ( VAT ) system due to be introduced in 1988 .
He gave no other details .
He said treasury bill maturities , interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly .
" In particular , short - term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985 , are now down to less than 10 pct ," he said .
Ongpin said the government ' s debt - equity scheme , introduced in August last year , had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications , but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61 . 8 mln dlrs at end - February .
He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non - performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform .
Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan .
Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank - led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors .
The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9 . 7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants .

JAPAN ' S NTT FORECASTS PROFITS FALL IN 1987 / 88 & lt ; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp > ( NTT ) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31 , 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year , the company said .
Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5 , 506 billion yen from a projected 5 , 328 billion this year , NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry .
NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1 , 770 billion yen in 1987 / 88 , including 109 billion for research and development , as against a total of 1 , 600 billion this year .
SWEDISH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY Sweden ' s industrial production fell 1 . 8 pct during January compared with a fall of 0 . 8 pct the month before and remains unchanged compared with January 1986 , according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics .
The bureau attributed the fall to a long Christmas break and particularly cold weather , which lowered production in the forestry industry .
BUNDESBANK ADDS MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY The Bundesbank came into the domestic money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4 . 0 pct , dealers said .
They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3 . 95 pct .
Call money fell to 3 . 90 / 4 . 0 pct after the move .
It had been 3 . 80 / 90 on Friday .
The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January .
Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients .
Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month , with the bulk being paid out next week .
In anticipation of this liquidity drain , banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank .
On Thursday , minimum reserve holdings declined to 57 . 0 billion marks from 60 . 0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53 . 2 billion held on Tuesday .
Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54 . 7 billion marks from 54 . 5 billion .
The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month .
With the heavy tax drain in March , banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary .
However , a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain .
The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3 . 4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over , dealers said .
PECHINEY SIGNS LETTERS OF INTENT WITH SOVIET UNION Pechiney & lt ; PUKG . PA > said it signed two letters of intent with the Soviet Union covering the setting up of packaging and packaging materials joint ventures .
It said one proposed venture would produce aluminium packaging for food and cosmetics .
The other envisaged Pechiney putting together a consortium of European partners to set up a packaging and equipment manufacturing unit in the Soviet Union .
A Pechiney spokesman said two working groups would prepare detailed projects over the next three months .
He said it was too soon to estimate the financial value of the two ventures .
MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1 . 8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador , the Middle East Economic Survey ( MEES ) estimated .
A landslide breached Iraq ' s one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week , and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months .
Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210 , 000 bpd .
MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2 . 9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3 . 1 mln bpd in the second , in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait .
MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300 , 000 bpd of its total production into floating storage .
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output , including Neutral Zone production , was around three mln bpd .
The Cyprus - based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850 , 000 bpd , compared with its 948 , 000 bpd quota , and that actual liftings are much lower than that .
It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55 , 000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices , but is still lifting 40 , 000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25 , 000 bpd of " purchase crude .
" It said small equity producers , with entitlements of only 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 bpd , had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices .
MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members .
The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices .
The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products , equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and " other forms of hydrocarbons " which are marketed in package deals with crude oil .
FINNISH INFLATION FALLS TO 3 . 5 PCT IN FEBRUARY Year - on year Finnish consumer prices fell to 3 . 5 pct in February 1986 from 3 . 7 pct in January and 4 . 6 pct in February 1985 , the Central Statistical Office said .
Consumer prices rose 0 . 3 pct in February after rises of one pct in January and 0 . 5 pct in February 1985 .
The consumer price index , base 1981 , was 142 . 7 in February , 142 . 2 in January and 137 . 8 in February 1986 .
EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept .
Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming - down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand .
Industry Commissioner Karl - Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988 .
He has proposed a return to the free market , which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of " manifest crisis .
" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries , with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red .
Ministers from the EC ' s major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes ' proposals and could back the industry ' s own plan instead , in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures , they said .
Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers ' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990 .
Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a " voluntary " basis to reduce capacity by 15 . 26 mln tonnes a year .
Cuts were still insufficient in one production area , that of hot rolled coils , and further talks were needed .
Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program , particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments .
The EC steel industry has already shed 240 , 000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes .
PEARSON CONCENTRATES ON FOUR SECTORS Pearson Plc & lt ; PSON . L > said the recent sale of its Fairey Engineering companies , in a 51 . 5 mln stg management buy - out , was part of its policy of concentrating on four key sectors .
In a statement with its 1986 results , the company said its information and entertainments sector ' s Financial Times , FT , newspaper had record sales and profits .
The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme , with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new plant in the London docklands next year .
Its other key sectors are merchant banking , oil and china .
Commenting on its Camco Inc oil service subsidiary , Pearson said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary .
The group has been acquiring oil properties in both the U . S . And Britain which will begin to make a significant impact on profits in the 1990s .
Far East operations of fine china subsidiary Royal Doulton Ltd are being expanded in the wake of record recent sales in Japan , it added .
Pearson reported 1986 pre - tax profit of 121 . 1 mln stg , up from 109 . 3 mln in 1985 .
Turnover fell to 953 mln from 970 mln .

Bundesbank data
GERMAN FEBRUARY CENTRAL BANK MONEY GROWTH STEADY West German central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7 . 5 pct in February , unchanged from the 7 . 5 pct reported in January , provisional data from the Bundesbank showed .
The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set by the Bundesbank for 1987 .
In absolute terms , the measure rose to 223 . 2 billion marks in February from 221 . 8 billion in the prior month .
The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8 . 6 pct over the six months to February , slower than the 9 . 4 pct rise in the same period to January .
Of the two components comprising central bank money stock , cash in circulation rose to 111 . 7 billion marks in February from 110 . 9 billion in January , the Bundesbank data showed .
This gave an annualized 8 . 3 pct rise over the six months to February , down from a 10 . 2 pct increase over the six months to January .
Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew to 111 . 5 billion marks in February from 110 . 9 billion in January .
This yielded an annualized 8 . 8 pct rise over the six month to February , up slightly from an 8 . 6 pct increase over the same period to January .

GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987 Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures , especially in the U . S ., Hamburg - based Vereins - und Westbank AG said .
It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ' efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing inflationary pressures in the U . S ., The world ' s biggest crude oil producer .
Money supplies in the U . S ., Japan and West Germany exceed the central banks ' limits and real growth of their gross national products , it said .
Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production , the bank said .
Speculative demand , which influences the gold price on futures markets , has also risen .
These factors and South Africa ' s unstable political situation , which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country , underline the firmer sentiment , it said .
However , Australia ' s output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73 . 5 tonnes in 1986 .
U . K . RETAIL SALES RISE 2 . 2 PCT IN FEBRUARY The volume of U . K . Retail sales rose a provisional , seasonally adjusted 2 . 2 pct in February after falling a final 2 . 2 pct in January , figures released by the Department of Trade and Industry show .
The February sales index , base 1980 , was put at a preliminary 125 . 0 after a final 122 . 3 in January .
In the three months from December to February , the level of sales was little changed over the previous three months but was nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period .
On a non - seasonally adjusted value basis , retail sales in February were a provisional 9 . 0 pct higher than a year earlier .
The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the January index , which was depressed by the effects of severe weather .
The February trading period comprised the four weeks February 1 to 28 .
Final February retail sales figures will be published on April 6 .

COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said .
Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated .
This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work .
The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations .
The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade .
A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend .
Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought .
One consumer country delegate said this would " distort , not support " the market .
Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder .
On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows .
The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices .
The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the " must buy " level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock .
Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given .
The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets .
A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement .
Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade .
It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes .
The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa .
Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday .
Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia .
Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas .
The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities .
European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities .
Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market .
Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa .
Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand , forcing all prices lower .
The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers .
EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations .
The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there .
One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is " meant to support the market where trade buying is not .
" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers .
Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced " posted price " as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers .
In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers .

MADAGASCAR RICE CROP ESTIMATED HIGHER IN 1987 Madagascar ' s vital rice crop is estimated at 2 , 286 , 000 tonnes of paddy this year , up from 2 , 138 , 000 in 1986 , the Ministry of Agriculture said .
The Trade Ministry said rice imports quadrupled in local currency value during the first nine months of last year as the government established a buffer stock of the country ' s staple food .
Rice imports increased to 82 . 4 billion Malagasy francs during the first nine months of last year from 20 billion in the same period of 1985 , the ministry said , without disclosing the tonnages involved .
ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments , but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments .
Ecuador said on Friday that last week ' s earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks , which hold two - thirds of its 8 . 16 billion dlr foreign debt .
" All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour ," the president said during a visit to the quake zone .
" A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain .
" Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments , Febres Cordero said .
He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that .
Meanwhile , Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake , which killed at least 300 people .
Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct , government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials , including the president and cabinet , would be reduced .
He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items , mainly food staples , while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct .
Gasoline supplies would also be limited .
U . K . MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST REVISED UPWARDS The Bank of England said it had revised its estimate of the shortage in the money market today up to 1 . 15 billion stg before taking account of its early operations .
Earlier , the bank forecast the deficit at 1 . 05 billion stg and gave 90 mln stg assistance at an early round of bill offers .
PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY Banque Paribas , which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre - finance oil exports , wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake , bankers said .
But the French bank ' s plan , which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months , is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate .
The pipeline that carries all Ecuador ' s oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair .
President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January ' s suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt .
Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil , which accounts for nearly two - thirds of Ecuador ' s export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue .
Although sympathetic to Ecuador ' s plight , many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks , bankers said .
The 18 - month oil - financing facility , which was signed last October 28 , is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region ' s debt crisis erupted in August 1982 .
Because it was a voluntary deal , many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to .
Otherwise , they fear , the gradual re - establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back .
" There ' s a lot of reluctance by the other banks .
They feel it ' s a different facility , and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad ," one banker commented .
BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range , a senior central bank official told reporters .
He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions , a dollar fall or a dollar rise .
Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability , but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks , he said .
The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time , the senior bank official said , but declined to be more specific .
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar / yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy .
Asked what factors might destabilize the markets , the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention , a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan , the U . S . Or West Germany , or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down .
The senior bank official said he expects Japan ' s gross national product ( GNP ) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April .
That would be little changed from the performance expected this year .
Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987 / 88 , but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point , he said .
He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy .
The economy ' s performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy , he added .
The central bank ' s monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy , the senior bank official said .
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half .
Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation , there could be some problems in the future , he said .
" We are sitting on a barrel of powder , but fortunately it may still be wet ," he added .
Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially , he said .
The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices , the bank official said .
This inflow of funds into the stock exchange , occurring also in other countries , may continue , he said .
BANK OF CHINA TAKES STAKE IN BAII HOLDINGS Bank of China has taken a stake in Luxembourg - based finance company BAII Holdings SA , a spokesman for BAII said .
The stake was between three and five pct but no further details of the deal , which was announced simultaneously in Paris , London and Hong Kong , were immediately available .
BAII , which is 50 pct Arab owned , is looking to expand its activities in the Far East and recently established a wholly - owned merchant banking subsidiary in Hong Kong , the spokesman said .
The group had earnings of 15 . 4 mln dlrs in 1985 .
SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC ' s December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it .
Nazer , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews , said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil , well below its OPEC quota .
Saudi Arabia , the world ' s largest oil exporter , will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact , Nazer said .
The 13 - nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7 . 25 pct to 15 . 8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1 .
Nazer , in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October , said : " I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our ( next OPEC ) meeting will take place as scheduled .
" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15 . 8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements .
" We ' ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified ," he said .
OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13 - year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact .
Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline .
Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4 . 133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price .
" As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December , Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement ," he said .
Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait , but not sales from floating storage , Nazer said .
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11 , said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non - OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC .
" Saudi Arabia doesn ' t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability ," he said .
Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of " swing producer " within OPEC .
Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over - production by some OPEC states .
" Saudi Arabia is not playing that role .
It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15 . 8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC ," Nazer said .
Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16 . 6 mln bpd .
But he said if circumstances changed " I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures .
" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer .
Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non - OPEC producers .
Norway , Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC ' s behalf earlier this year .
" We did not ask any country to do anything .
These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions ," Nazer said .
He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit .
TURKISH TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN 1986 Turkey ' s trade deficit rose to 3 . 65 billion dlrs in 1986 from 3 . 39 billion in 1985 following increased imports from Western countries , figures from the State Statistics Institute show .
Exports were down 6 . 3 pct at 7 . 45 billion dlrs , compared with 7 . 95 billion in 1985 , while imports were down 2 . 1 pct at 11 . 10 billion dlrs from 11 . 34 billion .

EGYPT , SOVIETS TO RENEGOTIATE ARMS DEBT TERMS Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo ' s three billion dlr military debt , Egyptian officials said .
One official , who asked to remain anonymous , told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year - old debt , and set a 25 year repayment term .
Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday .
Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha , who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday , met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue .
One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union .
Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0 . 38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable .
The fluctuating official rate is about 1 . 36 pounds to the dollar .
The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles , leather and furniture .
Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation , mainly in modernising Soviet - built steel , aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five - year development plan ending June 30 1992 .
Egypt , which already imports Soviet coal , wood , newsprint and glass , also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware , the officials said .
An estimated 65 pct of Egypt ' s arsenal is still made up of Soviet - supplied equipment , one official said .
Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then - president Anwar Sadat broke with its long - standing ally and turned to the U . S ..
PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING Peru will put into effect today a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country ' s international reserves , a government decree in the Official Gazette said .
Under the system , importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange .
The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange .
Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1 . 54 billion dlrs a year ago .
The system will be effective until the end of 1988 .
A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank , the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes .
The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council .
Peru ' s reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1 . 1 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary central bank estimates .
Total exports dropped to 2 . 50 billion dlrs last year against 2 . 97 billion in 1985 .

TAIWAN SAYS U . S .
WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE The United States wants Taiwan ' s currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan ' s trade surplus with the U . S ., A senior trade official said .
Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U . S . Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation .
Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U . S responded to Taiwan ' s request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May .
Taiwan ' s surplus with the U . S . Hit a record 13 . 6 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1986 .
Washington signed a three - year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0 . 5 pct a year .
Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U . S . Dollar since September 1985 .
It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value .
It rose four cents against the U . S . Dollar on Saturday to close at 34 . 59 .
Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U . S . Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise .
SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil , state - oil company Petrobras said in a statement .
Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees .

The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks .
Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday , Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers .
The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2 . 2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled .
The shipment was part of a contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125 , 000 barrels per day until June .

U . K . AND GERMANY LEAD ATTACK ON EC FARM REFORMS Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses .
At a meeting of EC foreign ministers , Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington - led protests from exporters to the EC , diplomats said .
West Germany , also opposed to the oils and fats tax , will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers , they added .
They said West Germany ' s objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors , the president of the EC ' s Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis .
Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts ( MCAs ) - a system of cross - border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports .
Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who , without MCAs , would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states , which means virtually all other 11 EC states , diplomats said .
Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations .
The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal , describing it as a breach of the EC ' s obligations under the world trade body GATT .
But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC , such as Senegal , Malaysia , Indonesia , Brazil , Argentina , Iceland and Norway , they added .
Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U . S . Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today , diplomats said .
But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month , they added .
HARPER AND ROW & lt ; HPR > TO MULL OPTIONS AFTER BIDS Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover bids that the company has received .
Instead , it appointed a committee of independent directors to study strategic alternatives for the 170 - year - old firm .
The alternatives include continuation of the company ' s existing business plans , possible business combinations , sales of stock , restructuring and the sale of all or part of the company .
Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on the alternatives , Harper and Row added .
Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a share for Harper and Row , prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a share from another publishing firm , Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc & lt ; HBJ >.
After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday , the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them .
The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company ' s independence and take advantage of its " considerable future prospects ," according to director Winthrop Knowlton , former chief executive and now chairman of the newly established independent committee .
" However , given the significant current interest in the company , we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available .
The committee will consider all the pertinent facts and alternatives ... We intend to make a careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a conclusion ," Knowlton said .
Pending its deliberations , Harper and Row ' s board has postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to recapitalize the company ' s stock in order to create two classes of shares with different votinmg rights .

BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war .
" The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I ' ve ever seen it in six years in Washington ," Baldrige said in a weekend television interview .
" I think we ' ll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration , but there is a hardening trade attitude ," he said .
President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation .
However , Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U . S . could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill .
When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war , Baldrige said : " Yes , I don ' t think there ' s any question about that .

LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability , but U . S . Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth .
The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month ' s talks seem likely to build on that stability .
A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm .
But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood , " That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels .
That is in fact what has happened since Paris .
" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short - term policy objectives .
Instead they have focused on medium - term policy goals , but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings .
The official refused to comment , however , on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year .
On February 22 , the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions , given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth .
The shake - up would strengthen the U . S .
Position in future international talks .
" I think these changes will strengthen the President ' s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora ," said the official , an Administration economic policymaker .
" So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives .
" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability .
Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short - term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention .
According to market sources , the ranges agreed were 1 . 60 to 1 . 90 marks to the dollar , and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar .
There is no official confirmation that specific bands were set , although the agreement used the term " ranges ", for the first time in an international economic agreement .
The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels .
Last week , dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark , which had breached 1 . 86 to the dollar .
British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling ' s strength .
International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers , who will review market performance and their own economic prospects , will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund .
The sources said Italy , which refused to join the Paris pact , was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker .
Since Paris , there are signs West German growth is slowing , while U . S . Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing .
Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank ( central bank ) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit .
A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany .
But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank .
" If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it , it would no longer be private ," said the official , who asked not to be identified .
Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged , but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U . S . Trade deficit remains stubbornly high , further coordinated action could be on the April agenda .
CALNY & lt ; CLNY > GETS BID FROM PEPSICO & lt ; PEP > Calny Inc said it has received an offer to be acquired by PepsiCo Inc , which already owns 9 . 9 pct of Calny stock , for 11 . 50 dlrs per share , subject to approval by PepsiCo and Calny boards and Calny shareholders .

INDONESIA HAS IMPORTED PALM OIL , TRADERS SAY Indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more , trade sources said .
They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity .
He also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia .
A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil to Indonesia in February , additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for April .
Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages .
Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low .
They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil .
Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135 , 000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April .
An Indonesian Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect .
Some traders here said the total could be more .
Others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority , Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy .
But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies .
Company profits and the stock market are rising .
But so is unemployment .
Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation , held to a 20 - year low of 2 . 1 pct in 1986 , is uncertain .
Forced last month to cut the government ' s 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate , Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy .
But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out .
The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year .
France ' s economic performance , led by a mixed cast of right - wing ministers and a socialist President , has won mixed reviews from non - partisan analysts .
For Michel Develle , Director of Economic Studies at newly - privatised Banque Paribas , the government ' s outstanding achievement has been to launch " a veritable intellectual revolution " breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control .
" The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms , they are excellent ," Develle said .
But some analysts say they fear that Balladur , chief architect of the government ' s free market policies , may be pursuing a mirage .
" The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological " said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval .
" Personally I think it ' s an illusion .
Dirigisme ( direction ) is a basic fact of the French system , from school onwards .
Ultra - liberalism is impossible .
" Illusion or not , the government has pushed its vision hard .
Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished , labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state - owned banks and industries to private investors .
Since December , nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas & lt ; PARI . PA > and glass maker Cie de Saint - Gobain SA & lt ; SGEP . PA >, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five - year privatisation plan .
Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital , and the lifting of most currency controls , money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad , helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12 . 5 pct since December .
At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing , freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy .
The immediate result was a 0 . 9 pct rise in consumer prices in January , partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast , to 2 . 5 pct from two pct or less .
" But even 2 . 5 pct would be a fantastic result , when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945 ," commented Develle of Paribas .
Other achievements include a major reduction in the state ' s foreign debts , and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141 . 1 billion francs last year , 2 . 5 billion francs below target and down from 153 . 3 billion in 1985 .
But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity , the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark , its second since Chirac took power .
A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted .
Outside the mainly state - controlled high technology sectors , French industrial goods were " increasingly ill - adapted to demand " and over - priced , the report said .
French economists , including Cheval at Indosuez , agreed with the report .
" One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom , the employers will invest and modernise .... But nine out of ten will say yes , they like freedom , and then wait to be told which way to go ," he said .
And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment , the end - 1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2 . 7 million , some 300 , 000 more than a year earlier .
The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth .
French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year ' s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan , they say .

GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987 Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures , especially in the U . S ., Hamburg - based Vereins - und Westbank AG said .
It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ' efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to growing inflationary pressures in the U . S . Money supplies in the U . S ., Japan and West Germany exceed central bank limits and real growth of their gross national products , it added .
Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production , the bank said .
Speculative demand , which influences the gold price on futures markets , has also risen , the bank said .
These factors and South Africa ' s unstable political situation , which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country , underscore the firmer sentiment , it said .
However , Australia ' s output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73 . 5 tonnes in 1986 .

ZAMBIA , IMF TALKS STALL ON FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia ' s talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies , an official newspaper said .
The Times of Zambia , which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party ( UNIP ), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them .
President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December , in line with IMF recommendations , but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots .
The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances .
The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government ' s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia ' s foreign exchange auction .
The central bank ' s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January , pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate .
The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction , losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months , but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar .
Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12 . 50 kwacha per dollar on the currency ' s devaluation once the auctions restart .

H AND R BLOCK & lt ; HRB > SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM With the April 15 tax return deadline less than a month away , confused taxpayers will be converging on H and R Block Inc ' s offices to interpret the new tax codes .
Financial results for the nation ' s largest tax preparer are expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a " bonanza ," analysts say .
" For the short term the key word is confusion , Block Vice President Tom Bloch said in an interview .
" When Congress drastically changes laws , confusion results and tax preparers benefit ," Bloch said .
" Next year , when taxpayers take the new forms and place them side by side to compare them , more people will throw their hands up and say ' I ' m going to get help ,'" he said .
" Tax forms will look very different next year ," he added .
Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block ' s fiscal 1987 year ( to end April 30 ) to show good gains over fiscal 1986 earnings of 60 . 1 mln dlrs or 2 . 41 dlrs a share on revenues of 606 . 7 mln dlrs .
He estimates Block ' s fiscal 1987 earnings at 2 . 75 to 2 . 80 dlrs .
" Next year , Block could have a bonanza ," Buchbinder said .
Based on estimates of a larger work force , Block could show a gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared , he said .
In the 1986 tax season , Block prepared 9 , 215 , 300 U . S . tax returns , up 1 . 5 pct over the previous year .
The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season , up from last year ' s 94 mln forms .
Professional tax preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms , according to the IRS .
For the longer term , while confusion will continue to bring clients into Block ' s 8 , 866 tax preparation offices worldwide , there are some changes in the act that will have a negative effect , Bloch conceded .
Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax return , and in some cases , simplify the form , he noted .
In addition , some low income wage earners will be taken off the tax rolls , he said .
Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to offset some of the negatives .
Last tax season , the average cost for each return in the U . S . amounted to 48 . 05 dlrs and 45 . 73 dlrs worldwide , Bloch said .
This tax season , rates will be up about three or four pct , in line with the inflation rate , he said .
Block expects " some expansion " this tax season of its electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and can speed up the refund process .
Block can choose where and by how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made available for the direct filing by the IRS , Bloch noted .
The IRS estimates about 90 , 000 returns will be directly filed this tax season , up from the 26 , 000 returns injected in the 1986 tax season .
First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988 .
Braatz expects Block ' s advertising budget to be about the same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for television ads .
" They may get a little more bang for their buck ," he said .
He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its balance sheet sheet , and says if interest rates rise it could be of great benefit to them .

LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement a full 0 / 92 acreage provision , or " decoupling ," for 1987 grain crops .
" I think there ' s a chance we ' ll see that legislation ( 0 / 92 ) passed , ( but ) not for 1987 crops .
It ' s too late ," Lyng told the National Grain and Feed Association convention here .
Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for 0 / 92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0 / 92 program will be passed as part of a pending disaster bill .
But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to alter the 1987 crop program .
Sign - up for spring crops closes the end of this month .
Overall , Lyng predicted very little change will be legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year .

WEST GERMAN EXPORTS TO U . S . DROP SHARPLY West German exports to the United States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the first time since mid - 1984 , provisional Bundesbank data showed .
The figures showed exports were 3 . 85 billion marks in January , sharply down from December ' s 4 . 40 billion and the lowest since the 3 . 56 billion exported to the U . S .
In July 1984 .
This compared with 4 . 86 billion marks in January 1986 .
Total West German exports to Western industrialised countries also fell in January to 34 . 76 billion marks from December ' s 36 . 45 billion , also posting the lowest monthly total since July 1984 .
West German exports to the European Community were 21 . 60 billion marks in January , down from 22 . 14 billion in December and 22 . 94 billion in January last year , the figures showed .
Exports to developing nations and centrally - planned economies also slackened .
Separately , Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area .
This was one of the strengths of West German exports compared with Japan , which depended in large part on the U . S ., OPEC and developing country markets , it added .

TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U . S . CONGRESS U . S . lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April .
In a move to toughen U . S . enforcement of trade laws , a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices .
This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year ' s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit .
Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U . S . products .
On the other hand , congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade , said the bill ties Reagan ' s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers .
Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee ' s bill was not one " that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects ," but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse .
Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was , " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements .
You ' ll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough .
You ' ll find poeple who think we haven ' t avoided violating agreements .
" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices .
It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U . S . economy .
Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat , insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law .
Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill .
As an indication of his success , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions .
But he added , " Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation .
I think we are progressing very well .
" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep . Richard Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , to force countries such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States .
The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices , but would not automatically set off retaliation .
Rep . Phil Crane , an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader , said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan .
Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition .
AFL - CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress .
But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement , " I ' m not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland .
I ' m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president .
" In writing the bill , the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles .
Rep . Ed Jenkins , a Democrat from Georgia , agreed to hold off his fight .
He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry , an aide said .
Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year .
House Speaker Jim Wright , a Texas Democrat , is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition .
Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption .
For the most part , the trade bill ' s provisions toughen U . S . enforcement of trade laws .
The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production .
It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence .
Congressmen said the change would have required the U . S . International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981 .
ENDOTRONICS & lt ; ENDO > EXPECTS LOSS FOR YEAR Endotronics Inc said it expects to incur " substantial losses " for the second quarter ending March 31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30 , 1987 .
As one factor behind the anticipated loss , Endotronics cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors , & lt ; Yamaha Inc >, over payment of a 3 , 686 , 000 dlr promissory note .
In a Form 8 - K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another Japanese distributor during the company ' s 1986 fiscal year .
Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit facilities in early May 1987 .
It said this assumes full use of the remaining 1 , 250 , 000 dlrs available under a line of credit from Celanese Corp , which requires approval of Celanese Corp & lt ; CZ >.
The company said its ability to obtain funding was adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against three officers of Endotronics .
Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges violations of the federal securities laws in connection with statements made in the company ' s annual and quarterly reports .
The company also said the Securities Division of the Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into the company ' s Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by insiders and brokers in the company ' s common shares .
It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The investigations will hurt the company ' s ability to obtain funding , it said .
As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory note , the law suit challenging its financial data and the various investigations concerning insider trading , the company said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the United States .

Texas Air said the settlement has other terms relating to employee shareholdrs of Continental , who will receive options from Texas Air .
It did not give details .
The company said the settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware Chancery Court , which is expected to take about 60 days .

COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules , delegates said .
While consumers do not yet have a common position , an observer said after a consumer meeting , " They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive .
" European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect , delegates said .
At the January meeting , France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate , delegates said .
That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules .
The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month ' s meeting .
The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues , delegates said .
The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non - member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa , delegates said .
A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non - member cocoa question .
A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning , then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting , followed by a consumer meeting .
Producers , who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non - member cocoa being accepted , reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon .
" We are waiting to see what consumers say ," a producer delegate said .
" We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate .
" The ICCO comprises 33 member countries .
Non - members include the U . S ., a consumer , and Malaysia , an increasingly important producer .
CCC ACCEPTS WHEAT BID FOR W AFRICA COUNTRIES The Commodity Credit Corportion , CCC , has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 15 , 000 tonnes of U . S . wheat to West African countries , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
The dark northern spring wheat is for shipment May 15 - June 15 , 1987 .
The bonus of 40 . 05 dlrs per tonne was made to Peavey Company and will be paid in the form of commodities from the CCC inventory , it said .
An additional 315 , 500 tonnes of wheat are still available to West African countries under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced October 30 , 1986 , it said .
LOWRANCE ELECTRONICS & lt ; LEIX > SEES ORDERS OFF Lowrance Electronics Inc said results from operations in the third and fourth quarter may not be comparable to the first and second quarters , which were strong because of orders for new sonar equipment .
For the six months ended Jan 31 , the company reported net income almost tripled to 951 , 000 dlrs or 34 cts a share as sales rose 38 pct to 20 . 6 mln dlrs .
The company , which went public Dec 23 , also said it expects to be able to fill back orders from the first two quarters because of improved supply of computer chip components .
CANADA MANUFACTURING UTILIZATION RATE RISES Utilization of Canadian manufacturing capacity rose to 77 . 2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 77 pct in the third quarter , Statistics Canada said .
" Although the change was small , this marked the first quarter since the third quarter of 1985 in which the utilization rates for manufacturing as a whole rose ," the federal agency said .
Increased residential construction led to strong increases in the building materials sector , led by a 3 . 3 pct increase in non - metallic mineral industries .
FRENCH INFLATION SLOWS IN FEBRUARY French inflation slowed in February to between 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 pct against 0 . 9 pct in January , the National Statistics Institute ( INSEE ) said .
The retail price index showed a year - on - year rise of 3 . 4 pct against three pct in January .
An INSEE official said the final figure for February would be released later this month .
After January ' s rise the government was forced to revise its inflation target for 1987 to 2 . 5 pct year on year from an initial target of two pct , after 2 . 1 pct in 1986 .
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February slowing .

CAPITOL BANCORP & lt ; CAPB > TO RESTATE NET TO LOSS Capitol Bancorp said it expects to restate its results for 1986 to a loss of about one mln dlrs due to a reclassification of loans recommended by auditor Ernst and Whinney .
The company said the restatement also reflects a substantial increase in reserves of its principal subsidiary , Capitol Bank and Trust Co .
It said it expects to earn 2 , 250 , 000 to 2 , 750 , 000 dlrs for the first quarter of 1987 .
Capitol said to maintain an adequate capital ratio it will seek additional equity capital in the near future .
It also said it has delayed its annual meeting until May due to the restatement of annual earnings .
Capitol said its board raised the quarterly dividend to 23 cts from 22 cts a share , payable April 28 , record MArch 31 .
The company originally reported 1986 earnings of 7 , 700 , 000 dlrs .
It earned 3 , 848 , 000 dlrs in last year ' s first quarter .
The annual meeting had been scheduled for the second week of April .
U . S . SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community ( EC ) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance , American Soybean Association ( ASA ) president - elect Wayne Bennett said .
Bennett , who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals , was speaking at a lunch .
After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning , he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal , as had a number of other countries .
" Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward ," he said .
" The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years , and dropped every time .
What we want now is to kill it once and for all ," Bennett added .
Backing up the soybean producers ' active lobbying , the U . S . Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through , he said .
The U . S . Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), a U . S . Embassy spokesman said .
U . S . Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one - fifth of annual production , and are worth about 2 . 5 billion dlrs a year , Bennett said .
The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U . S . Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC , which would suffer far worse than other higher - priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax , he added .
The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC ' s own oilseed subsidy machine , he said .
" We in the ASA are dedicated free - traders .
We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago , but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures ," Bennett said .
" The mood in the U . S . Is turning increasingly protectionist , and the EC ' s actions are fueling the chances of a trade war ," he added .
SWEDISH UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AS DATA IS REVISED A new method of calculating Sweden ' s unemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth , a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics ( SCB ) said , reporting a substantial drop in the past year .
According to the revised data there were 94 , 000 jobless in February representing 2 . 2 pct of the workforce against 120 , 000 or 2 . 8 pct of the workforce in February 1986 .
SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the Geneva - based International Labour Organisation .
Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed by about 16 pct .
" The way we are now collecting data is far more accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out whether the jobless want work , whether they are able to work and whether they have actually looked for work ," he told Reuters .
The new method was first used for the January figures , which showed unemployment dropping to 2 . 1 pct of the workforce from 2 . 7 pct ( old style ) in December , but Wessberg said the change had apparently not been noticed by the press .
Recalculated according to the new method , unemployment in February 1986 would have stood at 2 . 2 pct , the SCB said .
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe , economists say .
But many economists say the system , which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands , remains in its infancy .
Its new currency , the European Currency Unit ( Ecu ), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar .
And on Wednesday , the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe ' s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world ' s first Ecu coin .
But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system ' s founding fathers , ex - West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing .
Under this phase , originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up , decision - making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund .
But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters .
" The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common ," said one economist who has closely watched the system ' s development .
The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies , accentuating what the economists say is the system ' s greatest weakness , its vulnerability to a weak dollar .
Over the past 18 months , as the U . S . Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies , the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system .
Another frustration has been Britain ' s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound , still a major world currency , outside the system .
No change in the British government ' s attitude is expected before the country ' s next general elections , due by mid - 1988 .
Meanwhile , the system ' s last realignment , the 11th since it was set up , prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC ' s highly - secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it .
Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month .
But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details .
They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change .
" Technical measures won ' t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness .
For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level ," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank ' s economic research department .
Economists say the system ' s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates .
If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence , they predict .

GUADALCO has a processing capacity of 250 tonnes a day of sunflower seeds and 12 , 000 tonnes a day of raw cotton .
CCC ACCEPTS BID FOR DAIRY CATTLE TO KUWAIT The Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 380 head of dairy cattle to Kuwait , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .

The bonus of 1 , 465 . 00 dlrs per head was made to American Marketing Services , Inc , and will be paid in the form of commodities from the CCC inventory , it said .
An additional 761 head of dairy cattle are still available to Gulf countries ( kuwait , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced October 30 , 1986 , it said .

EEP SHOULD BE USED TACTICALLY , YEUTTER SAYS U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , should be used as a " tactical tool " and not as a general policy .
Yeutter made the comment in response to a question whether the U . S . should expand the EEP to cover grain sales to the Soviet Union .
He did not comment directly on the Soviet question , replying that any decision would be made at the highest levels of the Reagan administration , and " I don ' t want to preempt that .

SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions , a central bank spokesman said .
" The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations , in line with deregulation in the banking industry ," he said in a telephone interview .
The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday .
The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high - risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations .
It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain ' s financial sector , a move triggered by entry into the Community last year .
Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation , a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches .
Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system ' s lending assets .
Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1 . 5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas .
The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March .
Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans .
The central bank spokesman said operations over 1 . 5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation , but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days .
Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding , formerly obtainable through deposits , by issuing certificates of deposit , bonds and commercial paper .
They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues , while before they had to be converted into deposits .
Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies , instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency .
The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans , which previously were limited to three times a bank ' s capital equity .
The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers , in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates .
The reserve requirement , which was already in place on normal peseta deposits , was intended to curb short - term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government ' s money supply growth target .
A foreign banker said high reserve requirements , which now account for about 30 pct of deposits , placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors .
The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation .
" The real problem is the freeing of interest rates ," the banker said .
" This is going to take a big bite out of profits .
" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days .
The chairman of one of Spain ' s leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year .

UNION VOTES TO STRIKE DAKOTA CITY IBP PLANT Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union , UFCW , local 222 voted Sunday to go on strike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City , Nebraska , plant , effective Tuesday .
The company submitted their latest offer to the union at the same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of tomorrow that started December 14 .
Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that was submitted to the union late last week .
An overwhelming majority of the approximately 2 , 500 members attending the meeting then voted to go on strike , UFCW union spokesman Allen Zack said .
Zack said the company ' s offer for a cut in wages was unacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good faith .
IBP ' s latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for processing workers .
The cut follows the 1 . 07 dlr cut in pay workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted since then , Zack said .
The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours following the normal 40 hour work week , he added .
BELGIUM REVISES DOWN 1987 GNP GROWTH FORECASTS The Belgian government has lowered its forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in 1987 to 3 . 5 pct from an originally forecast 3 . 9 pct , Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament .
He said this revision , which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions , takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade .
But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be limited due to recent agreements on wages and working conditions agreed by employers and unions .
Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms .
However , last month the government ' s Planning Bureau said it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0 . 9 pct from 2 . 0 pct .
In 1986 , Belgium ' s gross national product rose 2 . 15 pct in volume terms against a 5 . 9 pct nominal rise .
INVESTOR GROUP HAS TALKS WITH PESCH ON AMI & lt ; AMI > WEDGE Group Inc , a Houston investment firm with a 5 . 5 pct stake in American Medical International Inc , said it has had talks with Pesch and Co , which is seeking control of the company .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , WEDGE , which is owned by Issam Fares , a Lebanese citizen living in Switzerland , also said it discussed the possibility of joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI .
WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control of AMI , but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future .
WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management , Pesch , the closely held health care and investment concern controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch , and other AMI shareholders .
It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues -- selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try -- were discussed with which group .
But it said the talks did not produce any agreements or understandings .
WEDGE said it believes that " some form of restructuring of AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate at this time .
" WEDGE , which holds 4 . 8 mln shares of AMI common stock , said it plans to hold further talks with company management , Pesch and other shareholders .
Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22 dlrs a share in cash and securties , or 1 . 91 billion dlrs based on AMI ' s total outstanding , from an all - cash 20 dlr a share bid , which the company rejected .

BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT External risks for the economy have increased , but growth of two to 2 . 5 pct this year is still possible , according to President of the West German Federation of Banks , Hanns Christian Schroeder - Hohenwarth .
Schroeder - Hohenwarth told a news conference the further fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West German exporters were facing a " rough wind .
" However , domestic demand was continuing to rise and private consumption in particular would support the economy , he said .
He saw good prospects for consumer industries .
Schroeder - Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth .
In this context , he welcomed a decision by the government to increase the scope of tax cuts due in 1988 .
He added , a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled for 1990 , which was worked out by coalition partners this month , was an " important step in the right direction .
" The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from 56 pct .
However , Schroeder - Hohenwarth said the decision to cut the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was " rather half - hearted .

CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICAL & lt ; CAAN > SEES FIRST QTR LOSS Cambridge Analytical Associates Inc said it expects to incur a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1987 equal to or greater than its loss of 240 , 697 dlrs for the fourth quarter ended December 31 , 1986 .
Cambridge said it expects revenues for the first quarter to be approximately the same as those recorded for the fourth quarter ended December 31 , 1986 , of 1 , 025 , 961 dlrs .
Cambridge recorded a profit of 2 , 204 dlrs on revenues of 847 , 000 dlrs for the first quarter of fiscal 1986 , the company said .
The company attributed the expected loss to lower than expected sales from its laboratory and consulting business and planned major investment in its proprietary treatment technology .

MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES U . S . Based speciality food retailer & lt ; Mrs Fields Inc >, which earlier announced pre - tax profits of 17 . 1 mln dlrs in 1986 against 6 . 8 mln in 1985 , said it plans further growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U . S .
The company , which is quoted on London ' s Unlisted Securities Market ( USM ), said it also planned to expand its outlets internationally .
However , chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but would intensify its efforts where it already had stores .
During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores , including 76 in the U . S ., Two in Australia and one each in Japan , Canada and the U . K . " We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London for example and it is reasonable that we might open other stores in other European countries in 1988 ," Fields said .
He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a matter of routine , and might add others in 1987 , but declined to say how much the company planned to spend on them .
Last year turnover rose by 20 . 8 pct to 87 . 1 mln dlrs from 72 . 6 mln dlrs in 1985 .
BRAZIL SAYS DEBT CRISIS IS WORLD PROBLEM Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country ' s foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system .
Speaking to a business conference he said " It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ).
It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries .
" " The crisis is not in Brazil , a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ... In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds ," he added .
Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U . S ., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil ' s decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt , he stressed the country ' s commitment to growth .
" We need to and will make the effort ( to solve the debt problem ) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing ," he said , adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis .
Brazil , whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world , has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems .
President Jose Sarney ' s government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund , arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession .
Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem .
" We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis .
" To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials .
The country was thus targetting a fall in this year ' s trade surplus to 8 . 0 billion dlrs from 1986 ' s 9 . 5 billion .
Domestically , Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2 . 7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986 , the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1 . 5 pct this year .

AROUND 3 . 5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0 / 92 A 0 / 92 program would have very little impact on U . S . acreage , prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3 . 5 mln acres of cropland every year , according to a report from the Agriculture Department .
The savings resulting from the additional 3 . 5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings , 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings , and 10 - 20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings , the report said .
The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0 / 92 acreage program for wheat , corn , cotton , sorghum and barley .
Last year , almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested .
" The likelihood that the 0 - 92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small ," the report said .
" The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage ," the USDA report said .
The 0 / 92 program , which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment , would be most used by producers in high production / high risk areas where cost of production is high , said Keith Collins , director of USDA ' s economics analysis staff .
" In the heart of the corn belt , you would not get that much participation ," Collins said .
USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0 / 92 , 1 . 5 mln acres of corn , 500 , 000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500 , 000 acres of cotton .
Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat , 180 mln bushels of corn , 20 mln bushels of sorghum , 10 mln bushels of barley , and 500 , 000 bales of cotton , the report said .
" In determining whether to participate , a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ...
The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered ," according to the analysis .
" What you ' re giving up under 0 / 92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production ," Collins said .
For producers with low production costs , that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs , he said .
Under these cicumstances , farmers would not want to go along with 0 / 92 .
But for high cost producers , 0 / 92 would be more attractive .
Also , as loan rates get lower , Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0 / 92 program .
" I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first , but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments ," Collins said .
In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association , USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0 / 92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month .

COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM Private coffee exporters say Colombia ' s more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions .
Gilberto Arango , president of the exporters ' association , said in an interview that Colombia , the world ' s second largest producer , was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) export quotas .
" Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation ," he said .
Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re - introduction of export quotas , suspended in February 1986 , and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue .
Arango said that government measures adopted here last week , including a lower export registration price , indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism .
" This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new ," he said .
The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price , or reintegro , will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends .
Arango said an illustration of Colombia ' s new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount .
But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee .
" Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently .
No targets for volume will be set .
We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away .
" Colombia ' s past records should be the basis for upcoming exports , he said .
" We will certainly not export seven mln ( 60 - kilo ) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad .
The trade knows full well what Colombia ' s export potential is ," he said .
Colombia , with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags , exported a record 11 . 5 mln bags in the 1985 / 86 coffee year which ended last September , and 11 . 3 mln in calendar 1986 .
Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986 / 87 coffee year would not exceed 10 . 5 mln bags , compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers ' Federation and 12 . 5 mln by the U . S . Department of Agriculture , a figure he said was " ridiculous .
" He said ageing plantations and rust , in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia , meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9 . 5 mln and 11 . 5 mln bags .
On the failure of the recent ICO talks , Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise .
Jorge Cardenas , manager of the national federation and head of his nation ' s delegation in London , has blamed the intransigence of some big countries , without naming them .
However , Arango , like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week , was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy .
" Washington will have to take into account that for many countries , and some of its allies for instance in Central America , a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far - reaching political and economic consequences .
" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts .
BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20 . 6 billion francs .
He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419 . 7 billion francs , against the previous government target of 417 . 8 billion , or eight pct of gross national product .
Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re - estimation by government departments of 1987 spending , the government calculated that unless action was taken , the requirement would exceed the target by 22 . 5 billion francs .
Martens said the plan involved raising non - fiscal receipts by 5 . 8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14 . 3 billion .
The remaining 0 . 5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations .
Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government ' s 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz .
Last year , the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs .
The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a " snowball effect " under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt .
In 1986 , the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 11 . 0 pct of GNP .
ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION & lt ; Royal Trustco Ltd >, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies , is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct , president Michael Cornelissen said .
First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust ' s international growth target is attainable .
But it " will be a tremendous achievement because ... they ' re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies ," Walsh said .
Global operations , which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust ' s 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit , will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit , Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview .
He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990 .
Royal Trust , Canada ' s second largest trust company with assets of about 19 . 54 billion Canadian dlrs , has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank .
Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s , when other Canadian trusts , the equivalent of U . S . savings and loans , were focusing on domestic retail banking .
The company ' s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations , which attained full British banking powers in 1980 , Cornelissen said .
Last year , Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co & lt ; DOW >' s Dow Financial Services Corp , which included asset management , merchant and private banking companies .
" It was a heaven - sent opportunity ," Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition .
" We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up .
" Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage , in order to exploit " profitable niches " overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management , private banking and advisory services .
He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations " before the end of this month " to sell its London - based Savory Milln brokerage , acquired in the Dow Financial deal .
" The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business ," he said , adding that in trust - type services , " we don ' t think the international markets are well - served .
" Aiding Royal Trust ' s foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad , Cornelissen said .
Central to Royal Trust ' s strategy is Asia , boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital , said Cornelissen , whose company administers assets of 71 . 85 billion dlrs , more than any other Canadian trust .
Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000 , Asia will contain two - thirds of the world ' s population and 50 pct of global productive capacity , Cornelissen said , " We knew we had to be there .
" Royal Trust ' s 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo , Hong Kong and Singapore .
The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange .
The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units , adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the " immediate future ," although " we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities .
" Asked about Royal Trust ' s plans for the U . S ., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units , Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks .
" That doesn ' t mean to say we shouldn ' t be in the U . S .," said Cornelissen .
" That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years .
" He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market , which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust .
Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks , trusts , insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another ' s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust , " but not drastically more ," Cornelissen said .
SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR & lt ; CAT > OPINION Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised its opinion on Caterpillar Inc ' s stock to an aggressive buy from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988 .
Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees 1988 earnings of 3 . 35 dlrs a share , up from an earlier forecast of three dlrs for the year .
The outlook for 1987 remains at 2 . 50 dlrs to three dlrs .
Caterpillar ' s stock was down 1 / 2 points at 46 - 1 / 4 .
" Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters , we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through 1988 and 1989 ," he said .
Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors - higher prices , improved market share , reduced costs , and improved demand .
The higher prices will stick because its Japanese competitor , Komatsu , has had to raise prices because of the increased value of the yen , he said .

YEUTTER REPEATS RETALIATION THREAT ON EC OIL TAX U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States will retaliate if the European Community adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils , but he did not say what EC products would be singled - out for reprisal .
Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association ( NGFA ) convention here , Yeutter said he is " cautiously optimistic " the controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers .
Yeutter said the proposed tax is a " flagrant violation of the spirit of GATT " because it would imperil the zero binding duty on U . S . exports of soybeans to Europe .
He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on a retaliation list .
The administration would not reveal a retaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal , he said .
CANADA ' S MULRONEY SAYS U . S . TRADE DEAL NEARS Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said " significant progress " was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging .
Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons , Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries .
Mulroney , who offered few new details of the talks , said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult , " a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging .
" In a 50 - minute address , Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost .
" Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades , we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising , one that is under - developed and under - employed ," said Mulroney .
" What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others , that they get their chance .
They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity .
" Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners .
Recent published reports in Canada , quoting senior trade sources , said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non - tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years .
It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes , something that would give Canada protection from Washington ' s tough trade remedy laws .
But Mulroney , sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U . S , said Canada was a " fair trader " and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market .
He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides .
" We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal , one that is fair to both sides ," Mulroney said .

EQUITABLE BANC & lt ; EBNC > BOSS HAS AMERITRUST STAKE A group controlled by Equitable Bancorp Chairman Alfred Lerner said it has acquired a 9 . 6 pct stake in AmeriTrust Corp & lt ; AMTR > and may buy up to 24 . 9 pct if obtains regulatory approval .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group said it bought its stake of 2 . 0 mln Ameritrust common shares , for 81 . 1 mln dlrs as an investment .
But the group , acting through Clevebaco L . P ., a Cleveland partnership , also said it would seek regulatory approval to increase its stake .
Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp , which is the general partner of Clevebaco L . P .
The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve Board on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pct of the common stock of AmeriTrust , a Cleveland bank holding company .
If the Fed approves , Lerner , whose Equitable Bancorp is also in Cleveland , said he intends to buy more AmeriTrust stock , subject to market conditions and other factors .
Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets greater than one billion dlrs , he said he is barred by law from serving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having his representatives on its board .
Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrust management or its policies .
The group said Clevebaco L . P . bought one mln of its shares from Bear , Stearns and Co Inc on March 9 at 41 dlrs a share .
Lerner said he accumulated the other one mln shares through March 3 and sold them to Clevebaco L . P ., which he controls , on March 10 for 40 . 10 dlrs a share .

U . S . COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter suggested the U . S . could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) challenging Canada ' s decision to impose duties on U . S . corn imports .
Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84 . 9 cents per bushel on U . S . corn shipments , Yeutter said the U . S . could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code .
Other U . S . options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts , or to retaliate against Canadian goods , a lower - level U . S . trade official said .
However , retaliation is an unlikely step , at least initially , that official said .
No decision on U . S . action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week .

BALLADUR MAINTAINS 1987 FRENCH INFLATION TARGET Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he was maintaining his 2 . 5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the announcement earlier today of a 3 . 4 pct year - on - year rise in retail prices for February .
He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0 . 1 to O . 2 pct , following a 0 . 9 pct rise in January ( three pct year on year ) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2 . 5 pct .
He said he was happy with " a good result " for February but stressed a need for continued " vigilance " against inflation .
A Finance Ministry statement said the year - on - year differential between French and lower West German inflation rates , calculated on the last three months , had narrowed in February to two to 2 . 3 pct compared to 2 . 7 pct in January .
If calculated on the last 12 months , the differential came to 3 . 9 pct , the statement said , adding " The tendency is therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main trading partner .

NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA Norway ' s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue , government officials said .
The unilateral boycott , proposed by Norway ' s minority Labour government , gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia .
" The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure , but as a step in an international process ," Norway ' s foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament .
Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime ' s apartheid policies .
Sweden , in a similar move last week , promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October .
Norway ' s boycott , although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian - owned tankers , makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea .
Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading , making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships ' final port at the start of a voyage .
Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa .
They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa .
Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s , but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months , trade ministry officials said .
The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986 , while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year - ago figure .
" Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway ," Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters .
" Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law .
" No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa , but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government ," he said .
The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law .
Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high - grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro - alloys and light metals industries .

DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today ' s downgrading of Denmark ' s credit rating by Standard and Poor ' s Corp should not be over - dramatised .
Standard and Poor ' s said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark ' s long - term external debt to AA from AA - Plus , following the country ' s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983 .
" This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise .
This is a change of nuance .
Standard and Poor ' s defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating ," Simonsen said in a statement .
" The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great .
But if , against expectation , we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit ...
This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability ," he added .
" Standard & amp ; Poor ' s has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving .
Tax reforms have also gone into effect .
" If and when it becomes necessary , the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past ," Simonsen said .
Standard and Poor ' s said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt .
The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34 . 5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29 . 1 billion in 1985 , bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns , according to government statistics .
Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year .
Denmark ' s net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983 , S and P said .

BP UNIT SEES U . S . GOLD MINE PROCEEDING British Petroleum Co PLC said based on a feasibility report from Ridgeway Mining Co , its joint venture Ridgeway Project in South Carolina could start commercial gold production by mid - 1988 .

BP ' s partner is Galactic Resources Ltd of Toronto .
BP said subject to receipt of all statutory permits , finalization of financing arrangements and management and joint venture review , construction of a 15 , 000 short ton per day processing facility can start .
Capital costs to bring the mine into production are estimated at 76 mln dlrs .

TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U . S . HOUSE U . S . lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April .
In a move to toughen U . S . enforcement of trade laws , a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned - down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices .
The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year ' s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit .
Generally , the bill ' s provisions toughen U . S . enforcement of trade laws .
The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices , such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production .
It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence .
In writing the bill , the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles .
Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U . S . products .
But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan ' s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers .
Bill Frenzel , R - MI ., said the subcommittee ' s bill was not one " that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects ," but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse .
The goal of trade legislation was " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements ," he said .
In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski , D - IL ., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices .
It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U . S . economy .
Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law .
Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation .
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill ' s provisions , but he added , " Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation .
I think we are progressing very well .
" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep . Richard Gephardt , D - MO ., to force countries like Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U . S .
The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices , but would not automatically set off retaliation .
Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition .
AFL - CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress .
But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying , " I ' m not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland .
I ' m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president .
" Rep . Ed Jenkins ( D - GA .) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry , an aide said .
Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year .
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas , one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low - priced foreign competition , last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption .

ETHIOPIA MINISTER SEES AFRICA DEBT PAYMENT PROBLEM Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy , Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said .
Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries , he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa .
Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries ' terms of trade " the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken ," Tesfay said .
The two - day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month , when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West .
Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements .
The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean " several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items ," he said .
Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country ' s foreign exchange earnings .
Adebayo Adedeji , the executive secretary of the U . N . Economic Commission for Africa , told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa .
He blamed this on high interest rates , debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors .
Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion , Adedeji said .
He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U . N .
Program for Africa ' s economic recovery and development , despite Africa ' s willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources .
The U . N .
Program , approved last year , calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years .
Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs , with the rest being raised from local resources , but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped .
In view of this poor response , he said " it is possible that by the year 2 , 000 nearly all African countries , except a few , will be categorised as least developed countries .
" At present , 27 of Africa ' s 50 - odd states are officially listed in this category .

ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW The International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow , delegates said .
ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a " pre - compromise " and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday , they said .
While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented , both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement , they said .
" I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day , but some time later in the session ," a consumer delegate said .
Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa , comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades , delegates said .
Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non - member cocoa also , and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin .
Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate , with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance , delegates said .
The semi - annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27 .
Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda , delegates said .

SENATOR UNCOMMITTED ON OFFERING 0 / 92 BILL Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana , ranking Republican on the U . S . Senate Agriculture Committee , has not decided whether to introduce an administration - backed bill to apply the so - called 0 / 92 provision to 1988 through 1990 grain crops , an aide to the senator said .
The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the measure , the aide said .
However , a number of farm groups have told Lugar they oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985 farm bill , and the senator has decided to take a second look at the proposal , the aide said .
Last week the aide indicated Lugar was planning to offer the 0 / 92 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation loophole .

ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE , OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued , but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge , delegates said .
Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September , with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year , they said .
Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely .
Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic .
But Brazil ' s unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30 . 55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord , other delegates said .
No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today , delegates said .
A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report , delegates said .

SCHLUMBERGER & lt ; SLB > ENDS PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor operations .
The company said the rising political controversy in the U . S . concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable time .
The sale has been opposed by the U . S . Commerce Department and the U . S . Defense Department , in part on national security grounds .
The company said termination of the agreement opened other possibilities , including a possible leveraged buyout of the semiconductor maker by Fairchild management .
In the interim , Fairchild would continue its ongoing business within Schlumberger , the oilfield services concern said .
Last October , Schlumberger announced the sale of the Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in the fourth quarter from the sale .
The company ended up recording special charges of 2 . 1 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , leading to a loss of 2 . 02 billion dlrs for the year .
Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale , but industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about 200 mln dlrs .
The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U . S . Justice Department .
Additionally , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge and other U . S . officials have voiced reservations about the transaction since it was announced .
Government officials have expressed concern that the sale could reduce the competitiveness of U . S . chip makers by putting key advanced technology into Japanese hands .
New , high - technology semiconductors are used in supercomputers , which are faster and more powerful than existing computers .
Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by French interests and headquartered in New York .

GENCORP & lt ; GY > 1ST QTR OPERATING EARNINGS ROSE GenCorp said its first quarter earnings from operations rose four pct as sales increased six pct to 650 mln dlrs from 614 mln a year earlier .
However , the company reported net income declined to 17 mln dlrs , or 77 cts a share , in the quarter ended February 28 from 19 mln dlrs , or 84 cts a year earlier .
This year ' s net included 700 , 000 dlrs from the sale of assets while last years was increased 3 . 0 mln dlrs by such sales .
GenCorp said lower operating profits for the tire and plastics and industrial products segments were essentially offset by higher wallcovering results .
NEW EEP DURUM WHEAT OFFER TO ALGERIA -- USDA U . S . exporters will have the opportunity to sell an additional 300 , 000 tonnes of U . S . durum wheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .

SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget , with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget .
In a briefing book for the drafting sessions , a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed , including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil , a fee just on imported oil , and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value .
Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs , including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone , more in later years .
The committee , however , will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax - writing committees .
The committee will draft a budget which its chairman , Sen Lawton Chiles , a Florida Democrat , said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues , or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind .
The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week , which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version .
The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint .
BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January ' s 129 mln , but was below the 628 mln of February 1986 , official figures show .
The director of the Banco do Brasil ' s foreign trade department ( CACEX ), Roberto Fendt , told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports , which totalled 1 . 53 billion dlrs against 1 . 26 billion in January and , after excluding coffee and oil derivitives , was only slightly below the same month last year .
Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices , he added .
Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year , the government ' s target of an eight - billion - dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved .
This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9 . 5 billion dlrs .
Exports this year are expected to total 22 . 5 billion dlrs and imports 14 . 5 billion , he added .
In 1986 exports totalled 22 . 4 billion dlrs and imports 12 . 9 billion .
Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1 . 27 billion dlrs from 1 . 12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth .
Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil .
In the first two months of the year imports , excluding oil and wheat totalled , 1 . 8 billion dlrs against 1 . 47 billion in the same 1986 period .
This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government ' s program for economic growth , Fendt added .

Top U . S . chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp & lt ; NSM >, Texas Instruments Inc & lt ; TXN > and Motorola Inc & lt ; MOT > might also seek to buy Fairchild , but could possibly run into antitrust problems , the analysts added .
Moreover , Fairchild ' s management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino , Calif ., company , analysts said .
In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu , Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities , including a possible buyout by Fairchild management .
The company said it ended the deal , in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs , because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time .
Analysts questioned this explanation , however , arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction .
Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned - owned companies .
" Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U . S . government didn ' t want it ," said Johnson of L . F . Rothschild .
A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company ' s news release .
He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit .
Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment .
Analysts noted the significance of the government ' s apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild .
Administration officials , including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems .
" The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry ," said Johnson of L . F . Rothschild .
" That , I think , is the real significance of this .
" Consequently , analysts said , the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U . S . complaints about Japanese chipmakers ' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer .
BRAZIL ' S TRADE SURPLUS DOUBLED IN FEBRUARY Brazil ' s trade surplus doubled in February to 261 mln dlrs from January ' s 129 mln but was well below the 628 mln dlrs of February last year , official figures show .
Director of the Banco do Brasil ' s foreign trade department ( CACEX ), Roberto Fendt , told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 1 . 53 billion dlrs against 1 . 26 billion in January and , after excluding coffee and oil derivatives , was only slightly below the same month last year .
Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February , 1986 , because of lower prices , he added .
Fendt said although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year , the government ' s target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved .
This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9 . 5 billion dlrs .
Exports this year are expected to total 22 . 5 billion dlrs and imports 14 . 5 billion , he added .
In 1986 exports totalled 22 . 4 billion dlrs and imports 12 . 9 billion .
Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1 . 27 billion dlrs from 1 . 12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth .
Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil .
Imports in the first two months of the year , excluding oil and wheat , totalled 1 . 8 billion dlrs against 1 . 47 billion in the same 1986 period .
This rise reflected industry ' s need for equipment to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government ' s program for economic growth , Fendt added .
PENN CENTRAL & lt ; PC > SELLS U . K . UNIT SAFT , a unit of Cie Generale d ' Electricite of France , said it bought U . K .- based Alcad Ltd from Penn Central Corp ' s Marathon Manufacturing Cos Inc .

Alcad is one of the world ' s largest producers of pocket - plate nickel - cadmium storeage batteries , used in industrial and railroad applications to start engines and as light sources , SAFT said .
SAFT said it expects to add 400 jobs at the U . K . operations .

CCC CREDITS FOR HONDURAS SWITCHED TO WHITE CORN The Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) announced 1 . 5 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked to cover sales of dry edible beans to Honduras have been switched to cover sales of white corn , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
The department said the action reduces coverage for sales of dry edible beans to 500 , 000 dlrs and creates the new line of 1 . 5 mln dlrs for sales of white corn .
All sales under the credit guarantee line must be registered and shipped by September 30 , 1987 , it said .

SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN A high - level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior USDA officials , along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups , failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level , participants at the meeting told Reuters .
" We didn ' t feel a lot was accomplished last week , but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary , and he didn ' t close the door on anything ," a member of the soybean delegation said .
At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4 . 77 dlrs ( without Gramm - Rudman reductions ) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn .
But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn , soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers .
Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week ' s meeting , but participants would not reveal what those options were .
" There were no surprises in our package ," one participant said .
Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates .
The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4 . 77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean - specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash .
This would have the effect of lowering the world price , maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government ' s soybean inventory .
A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week ' s meeting , participants said .
One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a " listening session " for USDA , and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department .
USDA officials , however , would not commit to any time frame .
Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future .
" USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market , so the Secretary was very non - committal ," a participant said .
U . S .
HEATING OIL FUTURES UP SHARPLY IN APRIL A supply shortage of number two oil in New York for prompt delivery boosted the April heating oil contract on U . S . energy futures , traders said .
Crude oil futures followed but gasoline futures lagged .
April heating oil ended 1 . 24 cts higher to 51 . 65 cts a gallon , while April crude settled 28 cts higher at 18 . 64 dlrs .
" The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract , which seemed to move higher because of tigtened prompt deliveries in New York Harbor ," said James Ritterbusch , vice president at Paine Webber Inc in Chicago .
April gasoline was 0 . 28 cent higher at 53 . 15 cts a gallon .
Ritterbusch said the market also found support from a report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC oil output was down to about 14 mln barrels per day in the second week of March .
" There was not a lot of interest to sell the market because of belief in OPEC ," said Richard Redoglia , a broker with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc . Redoglia and Ritterbusch said April heating oil could continue to rally above 53 cts a gallon , while crude futures could test 19 dlrs a barrel before profit - taking stunts the move higher .

MCDERMOTT & lt ; MDR > SAYS STAKE VIOLATES LAW McDermott International Inc said the purchase of a 5 . 4 pct block of its stock was an apparent violation of the laws of Panama , its country of incorporation .
The company said a detailed disclosure of an acquisition offer must be made to the Panamanian National Securities Commission or to the target ' s board before acquiring more than five pct stake .
It said transfers of securities in violation of these Panamanian regulations are invalid .
The company was not immediately available to say who had acquired the 5 . 4 pct block of stock .
ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws .
Icahn , who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc & lt ; TWA >, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14 . 8 pct stake in USAir Group .
The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12 , 1986 , Icahn said in the SEC filing .
The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons , including Icahn , violated securities laws and related rules , Icahn said .
Specifically , the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies , he said .
Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements , to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days .
Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes , but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated .
By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC , which is obviously already aware of its own probe , Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA .
It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders .
Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company ' s stock .
SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency ' s widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal , according to published reports .
Making late filings of 13D forms , which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company , or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to " warehouse " shares of stock .
In a warehousing scheme , a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them .
By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert .
Last year , the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc .
SMITHKLINE & lt ; SKB > AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is pursuing a three - point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder of the decade .
In 1986 , SmithKline earned 521 . 1 mln dlrs or 6 . 78 dlrs per share on revenues of 3 . 6 billion dlrs .
The company said in its annual report that its nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting its earnings growth target , and will in fact grow faster than its pharmaceutical business .
SmithKline , whose major product is the antiulcer medication Tagamet , said in the report that it intends to improve earnings from existing products , expand its product portfolio and optimize its financial resources .
To bolster its position in the antiulcer market , in which Tagamet has met stiff competition , SmithKline said its strategy to develop an over - the - counter version of Tagamet is bolstered by two joint ventures , one with & lt ; Wellcome PLC >, and one pending venture in Japan .
SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct annually .
" Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility ," Gavin Herbert , president of the eye and skin care product group said in the report .
In 1986 , Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln dlrs .
It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories pharmaceuticals unit , with 1986 sales of 1 . 9 billion dlrs , will file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a number of cardiovascular agents , including tissue plasminogen activator , over the next two years .
It also said SK and F ' s U . S . sales force will be 20 pct larger in 1987 , with more than 1 , 000 sales personnel .
Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing unit , with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs , performs 24 mln tests a year , and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in testing for the AIDS antibody .
Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the cost of money , it may buy back more shares .
In the last three years , it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares .
SmithKline begins the year with a new management team , including its new chief operating officer George Ebright .
ASHLAND OIL & lt ; ASH > SEES 2ND QTR OPER LOSS Ashland Oil Inc said it expects to report a loss from operations in the second quarter .
The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay down debt .
" However , it is difficult to determine now whether this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating loss ," the company said in a statement .
A company spokesman would not elaborate .
The company ' s Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss in January and February since it was unable to raise product prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs , Ashland said .
Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica , a retail marketing operation , are having a difficult quarter , the company ' s Valvoline , Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31 .
In the year - ago quarter , Ashland had income from operations of 93 . 8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses , taxes , equity income and other items .
Net income in the quarter was 39 . 4 mln dlrs or 1 . 12 dlrs a share on sales of 1 . 78 billion dlrs .
AMERITRUST & lt ; AMTR > SELLS TWO MLN SHARES Ameritrust Corp said it sold two mln shares of its common stock to an investment group named Clevebaco Ltd Partnership .
The partnership is controlled by Alfred Lerner , and a subsidiary of the Progressive Corp & lt ; PROG > is the limited partner , according to the company .
Ameritrust said it was advised that the Clevebaco group has filed an application with bank regulatory authorities seeking permission to acquire up to an additional three mln shares of Ameritrust common stock .
The company said the group indicated to it that it had no hostile takeover intent toward Ameritrust , and that the purchase was for investment purposes .

BRITISH FARM MINISTER ATTACKS SUBSIDIES Farm subsidies and protectionist moves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic , Michael Jopling , British minister of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , warned .
" It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States ," Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech .
" But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic .
We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks ," he said .
" Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others .
They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies .
" And above all , Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one .
" He added , " It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends .
" Jopling , who is a member of the EC agriculture committee , was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U . S . officials in Washington later this week .
Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils .
He said his government would oppose such a move because " We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support ( EC ) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer ' s expense .

BANKAMERICA & lt ; BAC > CHAIR SAYS BANK TURNING AROUND BankAmerica Corp Chairman A . W .
Clausen said the bank holding company is turning around and is back on the road to profitability .
In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce , Clausen said he was " absolutely convinced " BankAmerica would return to its position of preeminence .
" Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to reduce costs dramatically , to get our arms around our loan loss problems and begin to reduce charge - offs , and to enhance our revenue generation ," Clausen said .
Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth .
He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and operations , noting that expense growth in 1986 increased only one pct over 1985 expenses .
Clausen also said it will continue to phase out its overseas retail banking and concentrate on wholesale banking , with emphasis on a premium list of multinational corporations .

U . S . DECLINES COMMENT ON SCHLUMBERGER & lt ; SLB > MOVE A U . S . Commerce Department spokesman said the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd ' s announcement that it had terminated an agreement in principle to sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd . Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time soon .
The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U . S . Defense Department , in part on national security grounds .
Commerce chief spokesman B . J .
Cooper said the department had had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal .
A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware of Schlumberger ' s announcement and would have no immediate reaction .
Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had joined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have left the U . S . military overly dependent on foreign sources for vital equipment used in high - technology weapons .
Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed from ongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan , officials said .

ROYAL BANK / CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH Royal Bank of Canada ' s & lt ; RY > small Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada ( Brasil ) S .

" They ( Brazilian exporters ) are very interested in the Canadian market because it ' s an untapped market ," Brennan told reporters after a speech to the Brazil / Canada Chamber of Commerce .
Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to Canada .
He said he hopes to see medium - term financing facilities for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly , following an agreement reached in January with international financial authorities .
Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada reached about 700 mln dlrs .
Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this year from the three mln U . S . dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country ' s uncertain financial climate .
Brennan said he expects his bank ' s growth to come from increased exports to Canada .
Banco Royal is the only Canadian - owned commercial bank in Brazil although & lt ; Bank of Montreal > has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary , he said .
Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U . S . dlr foreign debt , because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy .
He said he believed Brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year .
Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil ' s interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada .

CENTEL & lt ; CNT > SEES LOWER FIRST QTR PROFITS Centel Corp said it sees 1987 first quarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits on telephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from 1986 acquisitions .
In the annual report , Chairman Robert Reuss told shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth in the investment base for setting rates .
As such , its first quarter 1987 results will be below last year ' s first quarter of 1 . 11 dlrs a share , he said .
" Several of the company ' s telephone units may be faced with a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their regulators ," Reuss said .
" This could result in some rate reductions and refunds to customers .
" Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress in Centel ' s business communications , cable television and cellular telephone units .
Centel is asking shareholders at the annual meeting to approve the tripling to 120 mln in authorized shares .

CEASARS WORLD FILES SUIT AGAINST MARTIN SOSNOFF AND MTS ACQUISITION ON TENDER OFFER
CEASARS WORLD FILES SUIT AGAINST MARTIN SOSNOFF AND MTS ACQUISITION ON TENDER OFFER
COASTAL & lt ; CGP > HIT WITH TWO BILLION DLR LAWSUIT TransAmerica Natural Gas Corp said it is seeking two billion dlrs in punitive and actual damages in a lawsuit it filed today against Coastal Corp , its chairman and certain Coastal affiliates .
TransAmerica , a privately held company that has been in bankruptcy since 1983 , said its suit alleges that Coastal and its chairman , Oscar S . Wyatt Jr , unlawfully interfered with agreements it previously reached with its creditors , causing the company significant damage .
TransAmerica also said its suit , filed in state district court in Harris County , Texas , seeks injunctions against Wyatt and Coastal to enjoin them from interfering with its contractual agreements with its creditors .
The company alleged that beginning in mid - 1986 , Coastal and its chairman took various steps to acquire its gas and other assets .
Coastal has used TransAmerica ' s bankruptcy proceedings to engineer a hostile takeover attempt , the company charged .
In its suit TransAmerican alleged that Coastal and Wyatt are " notorious corporate raiders who have been restrained in the past from taking over other corporations in their attempt to create a stranglehold position from which they could control and raise gas prices ..." " It is obvious that Coastal ' s efforts to improperly take over TransAmerican is a thinly veiled attempt to control a larger share of the Texas gas market to the detriment of end users and consumers ," the company alleged .
Coastal could not be reached for comment .
Company name is Transamerican .

The complaint seeks , among other things , to enjoin the tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false and misleading statements in the offer .
Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor , restructure operations , or buy back Sosnoff ' s holdings in an attempt to fight off the bid .

EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM The European Community ' s ( EC ) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses , after strong attacks from northern states .
Britain and West Germany , backed by the Netherlands and Denmark , opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U . S . and from EC consumer groups , diplomats said .
But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax , proposed last month as part of the Commission ' s annual farm price package , would leave a large hole in the group ' s budget .
He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good .
" I hope the debate is still open , if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget ," he said .
The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year , he said .
Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC ' s farm policy .
The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils .
Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers , mostly small farmers , who could be helped by the tax .
" What we are suggesting is reasonable , it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home ," he said .
Britain , normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC ' s costly farm subsidies system , warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC ' s trade relations with other countries .
Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC , they said .
The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts ( MCA ) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism .
In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President , Jacques Delors , Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers .
Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition .
The question was a key aspect of the Commission ' s farm price proposals , he added .
Ministers also agreed a 3 . 5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain , despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition .
The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter , by selling it at knock - down prices , turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices .
National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production .
Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme , which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year , but the two countries did not block today ' s vote .
AERO SERVICES & lt ; AEROE > IN PACT FOR NOMINATIONS Aero Services International Inc said it signed an agreement with Dibo Attar , who controls about 39 pct of its common stock , under which three nominees to Aero ' s board have been selected by Attar .
In addition to Attar , the nominees are Stephen L . Peistner , chairman and chief executive officer of & lt ; McCrory Corp > and James N . C . Moffat III , vice president and secretary of & lt ; Eastover Corp >.

Australia Feb current account deficit 750 mln dlrs vs Jan 1 . 23 billion - official
AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEB Australia ' s current deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1 . 23 billion ( revised from 1 . 29 billion ) in January , the Statistics Bureau said .
This compared with an 897 mln dlr shortfall a year earlier .
February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall ( revised from 287 mln ) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986 .
The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday .
February FOB exports rose to 2 . 82 billion dlrs from 2 . 74 billion ( revised from 2 . 72 billion ) in January and 2 . 54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2 . 77 billion from 2 . 99 billion ( revised from 3 . 01 billion ) against 2 . 70 billion a year earlier , the Bureau said .
It said a four pct decline in rural exports , despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports , was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non - rural exports , notably minerals and fuels .
On the import side , the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels , the Bureau said .
The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln ( revised from 268 mln ) in January and 192 mln a year earlier , the Bureau said .
This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in January and 354 mln a year earlier .
Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier .

The cumulative official capital surplus narrowed to 2 . 90 billion dlrs from 3 . 86 billion .
AUSTRALIAN RESERVES FALL IN FEBRUARY Australia ' s official reserve assets fell to the equivalent of 8 . 50 billion U . S . Dlrs in February , from 9 . 15 billion in January , compared with 9 . 06 billion a year earlier , the Reserve Bank said .
In Australian dollar terms , reserves fell by 1 . 24 billion dlrs to 12 . 60 billion after falling 1 . 71 billion to 13 . 85 billion in January and rising 792 mln to 12 . 92 billion in February 1986 .

Japan February wholesale prices fall 0 . 1 pct ( 0 . 6 pct January drop ) - official
Japan February wholesale prices fall 0 . 1 pct ( 0 . 6 pct January drop ) - official
JAPAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0 . 1 PCT IN FEBRUARY Japan ' s overall wholesale price index ( base 1980 ) fell 0 . 1 pct in February from a month earlier to 86 . 4 for the second consecutive month - on - month fall , the Bank of Japan said .
Wholesale prices fell 0 . 6 pct in January from December .
The index fell 9 . 1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year - on - year drop , the central bank said .
The reduced month - on - month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices , it said .
On a customs - cleared basis , crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January .
The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0 . 8 pct to 153 . 50 in February from 154 . 67 in January and was up 16 . 8 pct from 184 . 55 a year earlier , the bank said .
The export price index in February fell 0 . 7 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition .
The index was down 7 . 1 pct from a year earlier .
The import price index rose 1 . 1 pct from a month earlier to 57 . 4 for the sixth successive month - on - month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices .
But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier .
The domestic price index fell 0 . 1 pct to 91 . 9 in February , its 24th straight monthly drop , mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home .
Lower edible oil prices added to the decline .
The index was down 6 . 7 pct from a year earlier .
The domestic index marked its largest year - on - year drop of 7 . 1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system .
Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected , the bank said .
DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish , and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here .
" The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150 . 00 yen and to fall even below that level ," a senior dealer at one leading bank said .
The dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151 . 50 yen .
Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability .
Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U . S .
Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U . S . Treasury securities , needed to finance the U . S . Deficit .
Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably invite further U . S . Steps to weaken the dollar .
Under the Paris accord , Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus .
But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said .
If no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the U . S . Congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said .
The factors affecting the U . S . Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord , they added .
" Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still - sluggish U . S . Economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil ' s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran / Contra arms scandal ," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank .
" There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140 . 00 yen by the end of this year ," said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi .
But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention .
Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U . S . Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1 . 87 marks .
The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1 . 60 dlrs on Wednesday , they said .
But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar ' s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars .
However , First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said " The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March .
" Other dealers said the U . S .
Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 , because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings , which could make them lose interest in purchases of U . S . Treasury securities .
U . S . Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates , they said .
MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit , but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend .
The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1 . 23 billion in January .
It hit 13 . 82 billion dlrs in 1985 / 86 to end - June .
The currency jumped to 0 . 6858 / 63 U . S . Dlrs and traded as high as 0 . 6875 before retreating to around 0 . 6864 / 69 .
" It ' s got 69 cents written all over it ," one dealer said .
Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0 . 6820 U . S . Dlrs before the release .
The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March .
Banque National de Paris & lt ; BNPP . A > senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries .
Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0 . 6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow .
& lt ; Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd > chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2 . 77 billion dlrs , down from 2 . 99 billion in January .
But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor .
" We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term ," Buttrose said .
Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs , and added " Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable ( to the markets ).
" ANZ Banking Group Ltd & lt ; ANZA . S > senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained .
February FOB exports rose to 2 . 82 billion dlrs from a revised 2 . 74 billion in January .
Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news , with 90 - day bank bill yields falling to 16 . 42 - 16 . 45 pct from early highs of 16 . 50 and yields yesterday as high as 16 . 65 .
Longer term yields fell with 10 - year bonds at 13 . 66 / 68 pct from 13 . 74 before the release and highs of 13 . 87 yesterday .
The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading .
HONGKONG BANK SAYS CLOSE TO DEAL ON PROPERTY SALE Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp & lt ; HKBH . HK > is close to a deal on the sale of a commercial building in Hong Kong ' s Mongkok business district , a bank spokesman said .
He said the 21 - storey Wayfoong Plaza was likely to be sold for about 280 mln H . K .
Dlrs but declined to identify the buyer .
The spokesman gave no further details .
THAI M - 1 MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN JANUARY Thailand ' s M - 1 money supply rose 9 . 8 pct to an estimated 117 . 3 billion baht in January after increasing 6 . 6 pct in December , the Bank of Thailand said .
It said year - on - year M - 1 grew 23 . 1 pct in January after an 18 . 5 pct increase in December .
The central bank said M - 2 rose 1 . 7 pct to an estimated 686 . 5 billion baht in January after a 2 . 4 pct increase in December while year - on - year it expanded 13 . 3 pct after a 12 . 6 pct rise in December .
JAPAN TO RELEASE GNP FIGURES LATER TODAY The Economic Planning Agency will announce gross national product ( GNP ) figures for the October / December quarter today at 1700 hrs local time ( 0800 gmt ), Agency officials told Reuters .
In the July / September quarter , GNP rose 0 . 6 pct from the previous three months .
TAIWAN 1986 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS IS RECORD Taiwan ' s balance of payments surplus widened to a record 16 . 62 billion U . S . Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 9 . 35 billion in 1985 , the central bank said .
A bank official attributed the increase mainly to Taiwan ' s growing trade surplus , which increased to a record 16 . 8 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1986 from 11 . 2 billion in 1985 .
He said the deficit on invisible trade narrowed to 740 mln U . S . Dlrs from 1 . 97 billion .
Invisible earnings rose to 6 . 77 billion from 5 . 09 billion while invisible spending climbed to 7 . 51 billion from 7 . 06 billion , he said .
EC WARNS U . S . AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS The European Community ( EC ) yesterday warned Japan and the United States , its main trading partners , that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC ' s relations with both countries .
EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan ' s continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets .
They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U . S . Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react .
The U . S . Administration has already distanced itself from the bill .
EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U . S .
Counterpart , Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter , outlining the EC ' s concerns .
The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U . S . Moves towards protectionism .
" The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started , as well as on bilateral relations ," it said .
Any unilateral U . S . Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , it said .
In a separate statement on Japan , the EC ministers said they " deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ( and ) expect Japan to open up its market more .
" The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand .
Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U . S .- Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary .
One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop .
" It will be back on the table again and again ," the diplomat said .
De Clercq , talking to journalists during the meeting , said , " There is a certain nervousness , a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan .
" The EC is not satisfied with Japan ' s inability to cut its trade surplus , and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers , where it has imposed 20 pct anti - dumping duties .
But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war , and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research .
CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors , Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd ' s & lt ; CAPH . HK > 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline ' s forecast of one billion H . K .
Dlrs , stock analysts said .
Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1 . 1 billion and 1 . 25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company .
Cathay , 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd & lt ; SWPC . HK >, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year .
Cathay is expected to pay a 13 - cent final dividend , making a total of 19 cents for the year , as forecast in the prospectus , analysts polled by Reuters said .
They said the airline ' s performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs .
The weakness of the local currency , pegged at 7 . 80 to one U . S . Dollar , and low fuel prices moved further in the company ' s favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation , James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd said .
James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U . S .
Cents per gallon , 27 pct below the 1985 level .
It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay ' s net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1 . 25 billion dlrs .
Analysts said the company ' s estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative .
" This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased ," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities ( F . E .
) Ltd . Cathay ' s six - month turnover rose 19 . 8 pct from year - earlier levels , but profits rose 69 pct .
The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company ' s fuel oil bill last year , as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months , analysts said .
By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985 , the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct .
" Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay ' s major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7 . 2 pct ," said James Capel .
" This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7 . 6 pct .
" A strong performance from the 2 . 9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits , James Capel said .
A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay ' s revenue increase , but the company ' s load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services .
James Capel estimated Cathay ' s passenger - kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight - kilometres flown climbed 17 pct , though the airline ' s load factor probably fell to 68 . 8 pct from 70 pct .
" Cathay added new planes , and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air ," said Tsang .
" This affected its load factor .
" Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier & lt ; Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd > may have contributed to Cathay ' s decision to resume service to New Zealand last year , analysts said .
RENISON GOLDFIELDS EXTENDS LYELL COPPER MINE LIFE The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd & lt ; RGFJ . S > ( RGC ) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open for an extra five years following a new aid package from the state government , RGC said in a statement .
The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined , but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out , probably in 1994 .
The Australian dollar ' s fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price , making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1 . 95 pct against about 1 . 60 pct now , the firm said .
Ore output will be cut , but the higher grades will keep contained - copper output at current levels of about 24 , 000 tonnes a year , it said .
Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan , RGC said .
The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC , a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania .
The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid .
The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long - term bond rate , power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes .
NEW ZEALAND PRESS GROUP BUYS MORE TEXAS NEWSPAPERS & lt ; Independent Newspapers Ltd > ( INL ) said it bought two more community newspapers in Houston , Texas , through a subsidiary there , for an undisclosed sum .
INL said in a statement & lt ; Houston Community Newspapers Inc > bought the South West Advocate and the South Bend Advocate , with combined circulation of 74 , 000 copies , and associated assets , from & lt ; The Advocate Communications Corp Inc >.
INL publishes Wellington ' s morning and evening newspapers as well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in Rhode Island .
Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by & lt ; News Ltd >, an Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd & lt ; NCPA . S >.
Production and administration of the two publications would be transferred to the company ' s existing centre in Houston .
INL said the acquisition took effect on March 1 .
INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the subsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine community newspapers to 340 , 000 homes in the greater Houston area .
Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult because the city ' s economy depends to a large extent on the fortunes of the petroleum industry , but the situation should improve in the medium to long term and the investment will prove to be sound , he said .
U . S . AGRICULTURE SECRETARY WARNS EC ON SOY OIL TAX U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the European Community yesterday it will face serious retaliation if it enacts a new tax on products such as U . S .
Soybean oil .
Speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech , Lyng said he did not think the tax , which is still in the discussion stage , would be approved .
He said the U . S . Would take serious retaliatory action because if implemented , the tax would have a considerable impact on U . S .
Farmers .
KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to use the exchange .
Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry approval , the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at 1700 local time , and will close the account for trading at the new session the following day before the opening call starts at 0930 local time , an Exchange official said .
Trading on the Singapore rubber market , a major producer price indicator for Japanese end - users , is usually active after the end of the current final session here .
The introduction of the new session will enable participants to trade overnight after taking account of Singapore rubber prices , because brokers and members who are designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume traded overnight to the new final session before the opening session starts next day , the official said .
But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which sets a fixed price at each session , the price of contracts traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth session , he added .
Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures industry to expand and internationalise .
The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry , TOCOM , which also trades rubber futures in Japan , said it has no plans to introduce an extra session .

COASTAL & lt ; CGP > SEEKS TO HALT BILLION DLR LAWSUIT Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy court will hear its request today for a restraining order to stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by & lt ; TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp >.
TransAmerican , which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts , filed the lawsuit to block Coastal from taking control .
Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company , which is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican , would present its own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court .
Under the plan , Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an undisclosed amount .
TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values its total assets , including an unused oil refinery , at about one billion dlrs .
The company , the second - largest natural gas producer in Texas , said it has gas reserves of 1 . 2 trillion cubic feet and over 1 , 000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines .
About 80 pct of TransAmerican ' s gas is available for spot market sales in Texas during peak demand , it said .
Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales .
The lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one billion in punitive damages from Coastal .
Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market since 1979 , when it was forced to sell & lt ; Lo - Vaca Gas Gathering Co > to settle over 1 . 6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply .
Coastal , a natural gas producer and pipeline company , earned 71 . 6 mln dlrs on sales of 6 . 7 billion in 1986 , about half the its 1985 profits , due to slumping energy prices .
STUDY PREDICTS U . S .
DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A government study has concluded the U . S . Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability , the New York Times said .
The newspaper said the inter - agency government study found a serious oil - dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil .
The study concluded that by 1995 the U . S . Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil , more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973 - 74 Arab oil embargo .
The U . S . Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs , up from 27 pct a year ago , the New York Times said .
It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8 . 4 mln barrels .
The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves .
It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages , should be increased by 100 , 000 barrels a day , rather than 35 , 000 as called for in the 1988 budget .
The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers .
" The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ... Repeal the windfall profits tax , remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers ," it added .
The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U . S . Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced .

CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987 China ' s grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand , but will be not be as large as in the past , Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters .
They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large - scale imports , which peaked at 16 . 15 mln tonnes in 1982 .
An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year , against 7 . 73 mln in 1986 and 5 . 97 mln in 1985 .
Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand , but remained below exports , which rose to 9 . 42 mln tonnes from 9 . 33 mln in 1985 .
" China is short of foreign exchange ," the Shanghai official said .
" We cannot rely on imports , even at current low world prices .
Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer .
" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought , low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption .
" At current prices , China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports , though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs ," the trader said .
The People ' s Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13 . 3 mln hectares of arable land , which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year ' s level .
The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture , especially grain , making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986 .
" All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area , especially of corn , sweet potatoes , paddy rice and high - yield cash crops ," it said .
It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought .
Since January , the press has devoted much attention to grain , stressing that growth in output is vital to China ' s economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low .
Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output .
The Shanghai official said that in one suburb , 10 pct of the pre - tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture .
He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70 , 000 workers available to help farmers .
Chu Jinfeng , an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai , said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits .
Pan Huashan , an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province , said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province .
" In addition , we are setting up grain production bases , raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials , roads and other infrastructure ," he said .
The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time , or let other family members farm it .
In some cases , they lease the land to grain farmers .
The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000 .
It said growing grain should be made profitable .
" The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption .
Only this will boost enthusiasm ," it said .

JAPAN OCTOBER / DECEMBER GNP RISES 0 . 8 PCT Japan ' s gross national product ( GNP ) rose a real 0 . 8 pct in the October / December quarter after an upwardly revised 0 . 7 pct increase the previous three months , the Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) said .
The rise in the July / September quarter had originally been put at 0 . 6 pct .
The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3 . 2 pct in October / December from 3 . 0 pct in July / September .
In the 1986 calendar year , GNP rose 2 . 5 pct , after a 4 . 7 pct increase in 1985 .
Last year ' s performance was the worst since 1974 , when GNP fell 1 . 4 pct .
Agency officials blamed the strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry .
In nominal terms , GNP rose 0 . 5 pct in the October / December quarter , reflecting stable prices , after a one pct increase in the previous three months , the Agency said .
Domestic real demand increased 0 . 6 pct in October / December , after a one pct rise the previous quarter .
Domestic demand contributed 0 . 5 percentage point to real GNP growth in October / December , while foreign trade added 0 . 2 .
The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding .
In July / September , domestic demand contributed one percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off 0 . 3 point .
Of the 0 . 2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last quarter , falling exports knocked off 0 . 2 while falling imports contributed 0 . 4 point .

JAPAN OFFICIALS SEE DIFFICULTY HITTING GNP TARGET The government will find it very difficult to achieve its new gross national product ( GNP ) forecast of three pct growth in the fiscal year ending March 31 , Economic Planning Agency officials said .
They made the comment to reporters after news that GNP rose 0 . 8 pct in the October / December quarter , after a 0 . 7 pct increase the previous three months .
For Japan to achieve three pct growth in 1986 / 87 , GNP in the January / March period would have to grow 2 . 6 pct from October / December , the officials said .
The government lowered its GNP forecast for 1986 / 87 from four pct last December .
FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY Schlumberger Ltd ' s & lt ; SLB . N > decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd & lt ; ITSU . T > to buy 80 pct of its & lt ; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp >, and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale , will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U . S . High technology firms but will not halt such attempts , industry analysts said .
The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U . S .
Expansion by the Japanese firm , said analysts polled by Reuters .
" The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu ' s North American operations , but it would have been a great boost ," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said .
French - controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the U . S . Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time .
The sale was opposed by the U . S . Commerce Department and Defence Department , partly on national security grounds .
Fujitsu ' s acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology , an area where Fujitsu is weak , analysts said .
The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide , eight of them in the U . S ., A report by the Capel firm said .
" It was an entry point , a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things ," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May .
Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology .
"( Fairchild ) simply doesn ' t have key technology -- that ' s a thing of the past ," May said .
The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild ' s production lines , Capel ' s Murtha said .
The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U . S . High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop , analysts said .
Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the U . S ., Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm .
" It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions , but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains ," said Capel ' s Murtha .
" The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains , but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable .
" Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale , analysts said .
" They ' re not going to slow up , they ' re just going to buy smaller pieces ... Because of the political risk ," said Barclays de Zoete ' s May .
Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller U . S . High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers , he said .
Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming U . S . Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie - ups , some analysts said .
" This is not really of benefit to U . S . Firms either ," said Jardine Fleming ( Securities ) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards .
" The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it ?
" Japan ' s Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by U . S . Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate .
" This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments ' comment ," Tamura said .
" I think it was improper for U . S . Government officials to intervene to the extent they did ," he said .
A spokesman told Reuters the ministry ' s view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of U . S .- Japanese economic ties .
S . KOREA SAYS JAPAN COMPLAINS TO GATT ON TRADE PLAN Japan has complained to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) that South Korea ' s five - year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules , Trade Ministry officials here said .
They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea ' s plan to import less from Japan and more from the U . S . And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non - tariff trade barriers .
South Korea unveiled the plan in November .
It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991 .
South Korea ' s trade deficit with Japan was a record 5 . 45 billion dlrs in 1986 , and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period .
The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods , and to exporters to sell more to Japan .
The officials said they believed the Japanese action , one step short of filing a suit , was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan .
The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit .
AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY TRADING SET RECORD IN JANUARY Spot volume in the Australian foreign exchange market jumped to a record 22 . 63 billion dlrs a day in January from 16 . 18 billion in December and 8 . 27 billion a year earlier , the Reserve Bank said in its monthly bulletin .
The previous record was 17 . 51 billion dlrs last August .
The peak broke a steady trading trend of 15 to 17 billion dlrs a day seen in the second half of 1986 .
Including forward deals , total deliverable volume was 27 . 01 billion dlrs a day ( 13 . 43 billion against the Australian dollar ) against 19 . 56 billion ( 8 . 48 billion ) in December and 9 . 92 billion ( 5 . 88 billion ) a year earlier , the bank said .
JAPAN SEEN REDUCING BEEF , PORK INTERVENTION PRICES The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987 / 88 starting in April , but the cutback ratio has not been set yet , industry sources said .
Production prices , the basis for setting intervention prices , have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices , they said .
Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values , the sources added .
In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers .
The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi - government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp ( LIPC ) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market .
The 1987 / 88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25 , ministry officials said .
At present , the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef , known as marbled beef , is 1 , 400 yen per kilo , while its ceiling is 1 , 820 , they said .
The standard price of other beef , mainly produced from dairy steers , is now 1 , 090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1 , 420 , the officials said .
The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760 .
They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market .
Japan sets an annual beef import quota .
A semi - government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices , they said .

ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa , the official Times of Zambia said .
The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state - owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines ( ZCCM ) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa , but it did not say which alternative routes were being used .
ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report , but Standwell Mapara , general manager of the Tanzania - Zambia Railway Authority ( TAZARA ), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months .
During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa , Mapara said .
Last December TAZARA carried 36 , 000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore , the line ' s record for any one month period , he added .
Copper , cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia ' s foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them , avoiding the traditional route through South Africa .
Referring to Zambia ' s preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa , Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1 , " My main concern , of course , is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines .
" According to Mapara , TAZARA handled 1 . 1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1 . 4 mln capacity .
Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia ' s mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo .
The 1986 annual report of Zambia ' s state - run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country ' s metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year , versus 79 pct in 1985 .
The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463 , 000 tonnes last year from 526 , 000 in 1985 .
Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia ' s export routes , diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia ' s mineral exports , even if they could be hauled there by train .
" The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper ," one western diplomat said .
" A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage ," he added .
OECD JANUARY ANNUAL INFLATION STEADY AT 2 . 1 PCT Inflation in the 24 industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was 2 . 1 pct in the year to January , unchanged from December , the OECD said .

INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987 Indonesian sugar output is forecast by the government to reach 2 . 126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 against projected consumption of 2 . 039 mln tonnes , Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said .
Production in 1986 , when Indonesia was forced to import sugar , is officially estimated at 2 . 016 mln tonnes against 1 . 728 mln in 1985 .
The U . S . Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures .
It estimated 1986 production at 1 . 8 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987 .
Indonesia imported 162 , 000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks .
Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159 , 000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987 .
Industry sources said this represented under one month ' s consumption .
The minister said Indonesia should hold three months ' supply , or 510 , 000 tonnes .
A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau , which distributes and stores sugar , said stocks this month were 489 , 437 tonnes .
The harvesting season begins in April .
TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT Taiwan ' s central bank issued 12 billion Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit after issuing six billion yesterday , bringing CD issues so far this year to 115 . 47 billion dlrs , a bank official told Reuters .
The new CDs have maturities of six months , one year and two years and bear interest rates ranging from 4 . 07 pct to 5 . 12 pct , he said .
The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M - 1b money supply , which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves .
The reserves now total more than 51 billion U . S . Dlrs .

TAIWAN SAID CONSIDERING CURRENCY LIBERALISATION Taiwan ' s central bank is considering proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign exchange reserves of 51 billion U . S . Dlrs , a local newspaper reported today .
The China Times , which has close ties with the government , quoted central bank governor Chang Chi - cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions .
The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time , Chang was quoted as saying .
All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency .
Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds , treasury bills and certificates of deposit .
Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report .
Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls , but only gradually .
They said vast foreign currency reserves , earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States , made Taiwan a target for U . S .
Protectionism .
Taiwan ' s trade surplus with the U . S . Rose to 13 . 6 billion U . S . Dlrs last year compared with 10 . 2 billion in 1985 .
" The central bank has to go in this direction ," said Su Han - min , chief economist with the International Commercial Bank of China .
" If they don ' t quicken the pace , Washington could retaliate and really damage Taiwan .

ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe ' s state - owned Grain Marketing Board ( GMB ) will fall by over 65 pct this year , following a prolonged dry spell , agricultural industry sources said .
They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520 , 000 tonnes from 1 . 6 mln tonnes last year .
About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large - scale commercial farmers and the balance by small - scale peasant producers .
Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980 , the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe .
While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750 , 000 tonnes , the GMB stockpile is currently around 1 . 8 mln tonnes , which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years .
The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315 , 000 tonnes from 248 , 000 tonnes last year , and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100 , 000 tonnes from 84 , 000 tonnes in 1986 .
U . K . INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN JANUARY U . K . Industrial production rose a provisional 0 . 4 pct in January after a 0 . 6 pct decline in December 1986 , figures from the Central Statistical Office show .

Output of manufacturing industries fell a provisional 2 . 3 pct in January after a 0 . 2 pct rise last December .
The index for manufacturing , base 1980 , fell to 103 . 9 from 106 . 3 , and compared with 102 . 3 a year earlier .
The CSO said industrial production in the three months to January was provisionally estimated to have fallen by 0 . 7 pct from the level of the previous three months , while manufacturing output rose by 0 . 5 pct in the same period .
In the three months , industrial production was 1 . 5 pct higher than in the same period a year earlier , while manufacturing output was two pct higher .
Within manufacturing , output of the metals industry rose by six pct and that of engineering and allied industries by one pct between the two latest three month periods .
Output of chemicals and textiles fell by one pct and minerals by two pct .
The Office said output of the investment goods industries rose 0 . 1 pct while consumer goods output increased 0 . 6 pct .
Output of intermediate goods fell 1 . 6 pct between the two latest three - month periods .
The figures showed the energy production index , base 1980 , rose 7 . 2 pct in January to 126 . 4 from December ' s 117 . 9 and from 124 . 6 in January 1986 .
In the latest three months , the energy index , which comprises oil , natural gas and coal production , was down 3 . 5 pct on the previous quarter and 0 . 5 pct below the same period a year earlier .
ZIMBABWE GDP RISES 0 . 2 PCT IN 1986 Zimbabwe ' s real gross domestic product increased 0 . 2 pct in 1986 , according to preliminary figures published by the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ).
This contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985 .
The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output .
This declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year .
Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 1 . 4 pct .
The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12 . 7 pct to 8 . 2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs , but inflation , measured by the GDP deflator , was estimated at 12 . 2 pct , so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986 .
JAPAN SAYS U . S .- JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING Japanese officials sought to convince the U . S . That a U . S .- Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U . S . For them to prove their case .
" We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact ," Osamu Watanabe , Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ' s ( MITI ) Americas and Oceanic Division , told foreign reporters .
" The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place ," he said .
U . S . Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States .
The agreement , signed last September , aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U . S . Semiconductor firms ' access to the Japanese market .
The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U . S . Side about the pact , Watanabe said .
Yukio Honda , director of MITI ' s Industrial Electronics Division , denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries .
MITI ' s call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non - regulated grey market , Honda said .
" The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now , but in contrast U . S . And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices ," Honda said .
MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States , he added .
The ministry will soon release its supply - demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter , he said .
Despite businessmen ' s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls , regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results , Watanabe said .
" I am optimistic ," he added .
LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY ' S S . AFRICA BAN Norway ' s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue , government officials said .
The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia .
Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian - owned tankers , the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea .
As oil cargoes are often resold after loading , critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa .
Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s , but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months , trade ministry officials said .
The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986 , while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year - ago figure .
The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week , parliamentarians said .

DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish , and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here .
" The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150 . 00 yen and to fall even below that level ," a senior dealer at one leading bank said .
The dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151 . 50 yen .
Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability .
Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U . S .
Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U . S . Treasury securities , needed to finance the U . S . Deficit .
Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably invite further U . S . Steps to weaken the dollar .
Under the Paris accord , Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus .
But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said .
If no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the U . S . Congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said .
The factors affecting the U . S . Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord , they added .
" Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still - sluggish U . S . Economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil ' s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran / Contra arms scandal ," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank .
" There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140 . 00 yen by the end of this year ," said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi .
But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention .
Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U . S . Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1 . 87 marks .
The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1 . 60 dlrs on Wednesday , they said .
But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar ' s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars .
However , First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said " The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March .
" Other dealers said the U . S .
Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 , because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings , which could make them lose interest in purchases of U . S . Treasury securities .
U . S . Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates , they said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET RECEIVES NO MORNING ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it did not operate in the money market in the morning session .
Earlier , the central bank had estimated the deficit in the system today at some 450 mln stg .
IRAN SAID TO ATTACK CYPRIOT TANKER A Cypriot tanker was set ablaze in the Persian Gulf yesterday after an Iranian gunboat fired missiles at it , shipping sources quoting reports from Japanese tankers said today .
No casualties were seen and the tanker Pivot , laden with crude oil , was towed towards Dubai by tugs after they put out the fire , the sources said .
Iranian gunboats usually check a ship ' s nationality and cargo before attacking but the Pivot was hit near Bu Musa island without warning , they added .
BILLITON SEEKS CHANGE IN SURINAM POLICIES & lt ; Billiton International Metals B . V .>, the Dutch mining company , has urged Surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on bauxite mining operations there , a company spokesman said .
He told Reuters that Billiton , a fully - owned Royal Dutch / Shell & lt ; RD . AS > subsidiary , presented the demands to Henk Heidweiler , a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi Bouterse , who visited the Netherlands last week for official talks .
Billiton and & lt ; Suralco >, owned by U . S .
Conglomerate Alcoa & lt ; AA . S >, both want devaluation , and lower wages , welfare contributions , taxes on bauxite and energy prices .
The two firms are the biggest private sector employers in Surinam .
Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla group , the spokesman said , adding rebel fighting since July 1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants .
High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have been cut , and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut , he added .
" We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can ' t expect any company to remain operating with losses ," the spokesman said .
DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY - OFF PLANS Employers in Rotterdam ' s troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week , employers ' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters .
Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers ' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector .
The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers ' plans for 350 redundancies this year .
A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7 .
Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months , but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case .
" We cannot afford not to continue with our plans .
The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business , and further delays would do even more damage ," Zeebregts said .
The campaign of lightning strikes in the port ' s general cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers ' plans for 800 redundancies from the sector ' s 4 , 000 strong workforce by 1990 , starting with 350 this year .

ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986 , private economists said .
Consumer spending , a main driving force of domestic demand , was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year , the economists said .
They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0 . 7 pct in the Oct / Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years .
The report said Japan ' s gross national product rose a real 0 . 8 pct in Oct / Dec after a revised 0 . 7 pct increase in the previous quarter .
It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2 . 5 pct , down from 4 . 7 pct in 1985 .
Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1 . 4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis .
They expressed concern about the 0 . 7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales .
But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off .
" Sure , consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year , but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises ," said Shoji Saito , general manager of Mitsui Bank ' s economic research division .
He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries , particularly those hit hard by the yen ' s rise .
Masao Suzaki , senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo , said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor .
Without brisk consumer spending , Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures , he said .
Other economists said the 0 . 8 pct growth registered in Oct / Dec may have been inflated by special factors , including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector .
Johsen Takahashi , chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute , said the 14 . 4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct / Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins .
" This is just a one - shot spending and we can ' t expect that high level of public - sector consumption in the following quarter ," Takahashi said .
Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1 . 1 pct in Oct / Dec without the issue , which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito ' s reign .
Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending .
Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax .
COCOA WORKING GROUP MEETING DELAYED The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock working group meeting set for 1130 GMT today was rescheduled for 1430 , ICCO delegates said .
The meeting was delayed so a draft compromise proposal on buffer stock rules could be completed , they said .
ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn was preparing the plan in consultation with other delegates for presentation to the full working group , they added .

U . S . FEB HOUSING STARTS ROSE 2 . 6 PCT TO 1 . 851 MLN , PERMITS ROSE 4 . 4 PCT TO 1 . 764 MLN
U . S . HOUSING STARTS ROSE 2 . 6 PCT IN FEBRUARY U . S . housing starts rose 2 . 6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 , 851 , 000 units , the Commerce Department said .
In January , housing starts fell a revised 0 . 5 pct to 1 , 804 , 000 units .
The department previously said they fell 0 . 1 pct .
The rate at which permits were issued for future construction rose in February by 4 . 4 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1 , 764 , 000 units after falling 11 . 52 pct to 1 , 690 , 000 units in January .
Permits for single - family houses fell in January by 6 . 6 pct to 1 , 091 , 000 .
The number of permits for multi - family houses fell in February by 11 . 7 pct to 529 , 000 units after falling in January by 19 . 3 pct , the department said .
Housing starts in February included a seasonally adjusted 5 . 6 pct rise in single family units to 1 , 317 , 000 units and a 4 . 1 pct fall in multi - family homes to 534 , 000 units .
The seasonally adjusted permits total in February for single family units was 1 , 235 , 000 and for multi - family units was 529 , 000 units .
SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH Production of fish meal by the three South American producers -- Chile , Peru and Equador -- last year reached 2 . 5 mln tonnes , equalling the record output of 1970 , the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers ( IAFMM ) said .
However , IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651 , 000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986 , due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru in the same month .
The statement added that , due to technical market promotion and energetic sales by Chile and Peru , the stock position at the end of the year remained reasonable .
Fish meal production outside South America decreased slightly , falling from 114 , 400 to 111 , 100 tonnes .
The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West Germany , Scandinavian countries , Eastern Europe and the Far East , but fell in the U . S . And remained static in the U . K .
It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from competition with feed grade tallow in the U . S . And with skimmed milk powder in the U . K . IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producing nations , in thousands of tonnes , were - Oct / Dec Jan / Dec 1986 1985 1986 1985 CHILE 22 8 109 76 PERU 56 28 238 104 NORWAY 14 14 97 130 ICELAND 44 52 102 118 DENMARK 20 18 88 77 U .

TALKING POINT / COPPER STOCKS Copper shares , which have lagged behind the market , should pick up steam this year on stronger demand and improving prices for the metal , analysts said .
" Copper prices should move up over the next four to six quarters ," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co & lt ; MER >.
" I see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988 , up from around 63 or 64 cts , based on tight supply and continued world economic growth .
" Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988 .
Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp & lt ; PD > will be a strong performer because it is the largest U . S . copper producer .
But Asarco Inc & lt ; AR >, with about 45 pct of total sales from copper , and Newmont Mining Corp & lt ; NEM > are also potential winners , they said .
Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its copper operations to its shareholders .
" In theory , Phelps is the best stock .
It ' s the purest play and benefits most from higher copper prices ," one said .
William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co , said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining operations .
" They ' ve accomplished a great deal ," he said .
The company ' s move into carbon black , a product used in tires , should provide steady earnings , although not rapid growth , as a hedge against a copper downturn , Siedenburg said .
He estimates Phelps will earn 2 . 45 dlrs in 1987 and 4 . 45 dlrs in 1988 , including tax benefits , versus 1 . 79 dlrs in 1986 .
Other analysts , including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc and Merrill ' s Roling , also recommend Phelps .
Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3 . 25 dlrs in 1987 and four dlrs in 1988 , while Roling sees earnings at 2 . 75 dlrs this year and around 3 . 50 dlrs next year .
" The stock can go to the mid 30s ," Roling said , from its current level of around 30 .
But others see it climbing to 40 .
" Their ( Phelps Dodge ) costs are so low , they don ' t need copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money ," said Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc . " The shares will outperform the market over the next 18 months ," he said .
But Nick Toufexis of Prudential - Bache Securities Inc says Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment .
" We ' d rather place our bets with Newmont .
Any way you slice it , I see a significant premium to the current stock price ," he said .
After the spinoff , which closes next month , Newmont will have gold operations , including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co & lt ; NGC >, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations , Toufexis noted .
Analysts see Newmont earning 2 . 85 dlrs to three dlrs in 1987 and about 3 . 75 dlrs in 1988 , versus earnings of about 1 . 40 dlrs from operations in 1986 .
" I ' d be buying up to 90 ," Toufexis said last week , when the stock rose sharply to near that level .
" But the shares are probably worth about 108 dlrs ( each ).
" Dean Witter ' s Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like Asarco , because of cost cutting and restructuring .
Morrison sees 1987 earnings at 1 . 25 dlrs and 1988 at 1 . 75 against losses in 1986 .
Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and from three dlrs to 3 . 25 dlrs in 1988 .
Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co & lt ; CYPM > in addition to Phelps Dodge .
Cyprus has interests in coal and other minerals aside from copper .
But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced at current levels .
" I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock ," he said .
KOHLBERG KRAVIS HAS 96 PCT OWENS - ILLINOIS & lt ; OI > OII Holdings Corp , a company formed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co , said it received and purchased about 58 . 3 mln shares or 96 pct of Owens - Illinois Inc common stock and 50 , 275 of 4 . 75 dlr cumulative convertible preference shares of Owens , or about 83 pct .
The company said its tender offer for all common and preference shares expired last night .
It said Owens - Illinois will be merged into a subsidiary of OII Holdings on March 24 .
Common shares not bought in the offer will be converted into the right to receive 60 . 50 dlrs per share in cash , the tender price .

EC WARNS U . S . AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS The European Community ( EC ) yesterday warned Japan and the United States , its main trading partners , that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC ' s relations with both countries .
EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan ' s continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets .
They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U . S . Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react .
The U . S . Administration has already distanced itself from the bill .
EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U . S .
Counterpart , Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter , outlining the EC ' s concerns .
The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U . S . Moves towards protectionism .
" The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started , as well as on bilateral relations ," it said .
Any unilateral U . S . Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , it said .
In a separate statement on Japan , the EC ministers said they " deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ( and ) expect Japan to open up its market more .
" The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand .
Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U . S .- Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary .
One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop .
" It will be back on the table again and again ," the diplomat said .
De Clercq , talking to journalists during the meeting , said , " There is a certain nervousness , a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan .
" But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war , and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research .
RENEWED BULL SPREADING LIKELY ON CATTLE REPORT Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday ' s USDA 7 - state cattle on feed report .
The USDA reported high placements in February , which may weigh on back months of cattle futures .
Meanwhile , continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract .
Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady , analysts said .
Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed , according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom O ' Hare .
" They have no place to send the grain ," he said .
Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report , analysts said .
" The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report ," said Robin Fuller , analyst for Agri Analysis .
She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess , many traders had expected high placements .
Placements are not that negative , especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week , GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said .
He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month .
Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace .
Chuck Levitt , analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year , a three pct decline in marketings was expected .
But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct , Levitt noted .
" So far we haven ' t seen any decline in marketings .
They ( feedlot operators ) are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter , which is a bullish development ," Levitt said .
Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago .
Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace .

JAPAN ALERTS GATT TO SOUTH KOREA IMPORT PLAN Japan told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that South Korea ' s five - year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said .
The notification came in Japan ' s answer to a recent GATT questionnaire on unfair trade practices , the spokesman said .
In the five - year plan , which starts this year , South Korea aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the U . S . And Europe .
Japan ' s move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan , the spokesman said .
" The notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint , nor is it intended to pressure South Korea .
It is a routine procedure followed by all other GATT member states .

U . S . CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT RECORD 36 . 84 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR 1986
U . S . CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT 36 . 84 BILLION DLRS The U . S . current account deficit widened to a record 36 . 84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments basis in the October - December fourth quarter of 1986 from a revised 35 . 29 billion dlrs in the third quarter , the Commerce Department said .
Previously , the department said the third - quarter deficit was 36 . 28 billion dlrs .
For the full year 1986 , the current account , a broad measure of trade performance , was in deficit a record 140 . 57 billion dlrs after a 117 . 68 billion dlr deficit in 1985 .
The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38 . 4 billion dlrs from 37 . 1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit .
Net service receipts declined to 5 . 5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter .
The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U . S . financial transactions with the rest of the world .
The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147 . 7 billion from 124 . 4 billion dlrs in 1985 .
Net service receipts were 22 . 3 billion dlrs in 1986 , compared with 21 . 7 billion dlrs in 1985 , the department said .
Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year , covering foreign aid and government pensions , were down to 3 . 9 billion dlrs from 4 . 2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U . S . government grants to Mideast countries .
Liabilities to foreigners reported by U . S . banks rose 35 . 3 billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30 . 1 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
For the full year , these liabilities grew 77 . 4 billion dlrs after rising by 40 . 4 billion dlrs in 1985 .
The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions .
Net foreign sales of U . S . Treasury securities by foreigners were 2 . 7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter .
Net foreign purchases of securities other than U . S . Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11 . 8 billion dlrs , compared with 17 . 2 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
For all 1986 , foreign purchases of securities excluding U . S . Treasury securities were a record 70 . 7 billion dlrs , surpassing the previous record 50 . 9 billion dlr total in 1985 .
Claims on foreigners reported by U . S . banks in the fourth quarter rose 29 . 9 billion dlrs after a 19 . 3 billion dlr third - quarter increase .
U . S . sales of foreign securities rose to 2 . 7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds , the department said .
Outflows for U . S . direct investment abroad fell to 5 . 7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter .
Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14 . 4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , compared with 5 . 6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter , because of stepped - up acquisitions , the department said .
Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15 . 4 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
For the full year 1986 , foreign official assets grew 33 . 4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1 . 9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell , commerce said .

DUTCH OFFICIAL WARNS OF MORE TRADE CONFLICTS Already strained relations between the U . S . And the European Community ( EC ) are likely to get worse before they get better , director general of the Dutch Economics Ministry ' s foreign affairs division Frans Engering said .
Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The Hague , Engering noted the developing history of crises over steel , citrus and pasta , and warned of more to come .
" I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus ill - advised , and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation ," he said .
" I feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future .
" Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get the American balance of payments into better shape , but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure , Engering noted .
" If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war , then I think the answer is probably yes ," he said .
In order to reduce these tensions , decision - making in the EC must become less self - centred , and the US Administration will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation , he added .

U . S . TREASURY ANNOUNCES OECD TIED - AID PACT U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade .
He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration ' s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies .
The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports , the Treasury said .
The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July , 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries .
It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries , the Treasury said .
Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan ' s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government ' s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues .

SOVIETS SAID TO SEE NEW FLOOR FOR GRAIN OUTPUT The intensive technology concept for grain production has put a new floor under USSR grain production , the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s officer in Moscow said in a field report .
The report , quoting a broadcast on Radio Moscow , said that due to intensive technology grain production in a " bad year " will not fall below 200 mln tonnes , and in a " good year " grain production could reach 250 mln tonnes .
The U . S . Agriculture Department currently forecasts this year ' s USSR crop at 210 . 1 mln tonnes , and if realized this would be the third year since 1975 that the Soviet Union ' s grain harvest has exceeded 200 . 0 mln tonnes .
The largest crop since 1975 was 237 . 4 mln tonnes harvested in 1978 , according to USDA data .
OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said .
The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so - called " mixed credits ," the OECD said .
The agreement , to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988 , means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct , and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world ' s least developed nations .
Additionally , a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits , to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries , the 24 - nation OECD , which hosted the reform negotiations , said .
Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies , and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year .
The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U . S . To stop competitors , notably France and Japan , using foreign aid to subsidise exports , putting U . S . Firms at a disadvantage .
OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments .
Some governments , including Austria , had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid - April , they added .
By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use .
" A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today ," a senior U . S . Official here commented .

U . K . BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson , presenting his budget for fiscal 1987 / 88 to Parliament , said U . K . Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 .
He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2 . 5 billion stg , after a 1 . 1 billion shortfall in 1986 .
Inflation is expected to be 4 . 0 pct at the end of this year , Lawson said .
" As I forecast in the Autumn Statement , inflation may continue to edge up for a time , perhaps exceeding 4 . 5 pct by the summer , before falling back to 4 . 0 pct by the end of the year ," he added .
Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement ( PSBR ), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986 / 87 was 4 . 0 billion stg , or 1 . 0 pct of GDP .
The planned PSBR for 1987 / 88 was set at 4 . 0 billion stg .
On monetary policy , Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987 / 88 .
No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate , he said .
" But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions , as of course will the exchange rate ," the Chancellor told Parliament .
Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986 / 87 " is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non - oil tax revenues in general , and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular .
" On oil prices , Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 .
He said " it is clear that the increased flow of non - oil tax revenues , coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure , puts the public finances in a very strong position .
" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1 . 0 pct of GDP in future .
" We have reached what I judge to be the ( Medium Term Financial Strategy ' s ) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1 . 0 pct of GDP .
My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead ," Lawson said .
" Inevitably , this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation , which of course remains a major objective of government policy .
" " But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution , and to build a still firmer base for the future .
" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book .
On corporation tax , he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987 / 88 .
But companies ' capital gains will be charged at the " appropriate corporation tax rate .
" He said that under the new proposed system , companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ( ACT ) payments against tax on capital gains .
" Taken together , these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988 / 89 ," Lawson said .
Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax , " with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due .
" " I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax , to be known as Pay and File .
" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection , and would not come into force until the early 1990s .
Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ).
As from today , companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their ( PRT ) liabilities in existing fields , until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred .
Second , there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U . K . Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field .
On business employment , Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers .
Lawson said that in future , traders registered for Value Added Tax ( VAT ) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received .
Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly .
The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days , he added , and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21 , 300 stg .
New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance , he added .
The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125 , 000 stg .
Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment .
The change will take effect on April 1 , 1987 , but " genuine trading companies " will not be affected .
He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans , also from April 1 .
" In future , banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan ," he said .
The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence , to 27 pct from 29 pct .
Lawson reiterated the government ' s aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound , but added " given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR , that goal cannot be achieved in this budget .
" Small companies ' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct , he said .
On the Lloyd ' s insurance market , Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd ' s syndicates , bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders .
The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd ' s about the details of the legislation , he said .
" The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd ' s account which closes on December 31 this year ," Lawson said .

SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U . S . OIL STOCKS Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in holding to its prescribed production quotas .
" It is clear that OPEC , through jawboning and quota restraint , will boost the price of oil ," Margoshes said .
Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas .
Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil & lt ; IMO . A >, up 1 / 2 to 49 - 1 / 8 , Standard Oil Co & lt ; SRD >, 7 / 8 to 62 - 3 / 4 , Exxon & lt ; XON > one to 83 - 1 / 8 , and Chevron & lt ; CHV > 1 - 1 / 8 to 54 - 7 / 8 .

ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South Africa and announced that its state - run mining company had closed down its liaison office in the white - ruled republic .
He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an interview the government was diverting all mineral exports along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in Mozambique .
Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports , but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements .
" So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance ," he told the Times .
The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100 , 000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17 , 000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986 .
Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia ' s ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports .
Chitambala also said that the state - run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines ( ZCCM ) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg , since it was now redundant .

U . K . GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson , presenting his budget for fiscal 1987 / 88 to parliament , said U . K . Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 .
He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2 . 5 billion stg , after a 1 . 1 billion shortfall in 1986 .
Inflation is expected to be 4 . 0 pct at the end of 1987 , he said , adding it may exceed 4 . 5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4 . 0 pct by the end of the year .
The planned PSBR for 1987 / 88 was 4 . 0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986 / 87 , Lawson said .
Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply , Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate .
The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986 / 87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non - oil tax revenues in general , and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular .
On oil prices , Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 .
The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1 . 0 pct of GDP in future , he said .

EC OILS TAX NO LONGER MAJOR ISSUE - ASSOCIATION The proposed European Community ( EC ) tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat , the West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association ( MFI ) said .
Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference the West German feed industry believes the EC does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war .
" We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U . S . And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies .
" American Soybean Association ( ASA ) president - elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U . S .
Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected .
Bennett , who is leading one of three soybean delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals , will also visit Bonn on Thursday and Friday .
There are indications the Bonn government will also reject the proposed tax , Wagner said .

EXXON & lt ; XON > MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY Exxon Corp , the world ' s largest oil company , said in a published interview today that it was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close on of its french refineries .
Lee R . Raymond , Exxon ' s new president , singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon ' s refineries in France during the interview .
An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named .
She also said that all of Exxon ' s opertations were under constant review .
Exxon currently has two refineries in France , FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175 , 000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity .
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly , an influential trade journal , said , in its current issue , that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp , Southern France or possibly Italy .
Paul Mlotok , oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation , its future profits there should be good .
" Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe , upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market .
Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations , Exxon should show superior earnings ," Mlotok said .
" Just after Royal Dutch & lt ; RD >, they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in Europe ," he added .
Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations .
PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export refineries .
PIW said " sales from Libya , Algeria and elsewhere are expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last year .

ITALY STANCE ON EC OILS TAX NOT ENCOURAGING - ASA Italy ' s response to protests by U . S .
Soybean producers about the proposed European Community ( EC ) tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging , American Soybean Association ( ASA ) board chairman George Fluegel said .
Fluegel , heading one of three U . S .
Soybean producer delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries , told Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the proposed tax .
Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry , but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared " more realistic .
" He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U . S .
Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC ' s Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) on oilseeds .
Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax , he said , " Realistically , from the information we ' re getting , it looks like the English , the Germans , hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark .
" His delegation also hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue , he added .
Asked what form he thought U . S .
Retaliatory action might take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved , Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could be involved .
U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the tax .
ASA president - elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed tax would be rejected .
ISRAEL ' S FIVE - YEAR PLAN TO BOOST AGRICULTURE Israel has drawn up a five - year plan for 1987 - 1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 2 . 7 billion dlrs , an annual rise of 3 . 4 pct , the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture said .

GENSTAR SALE BOOSTS BELGIAN SOCIETE GENERALE NET Societe Generale de Belgique & lt ; BELB . BR > said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp .
The company , which announced a net non - consolidated profit of 5 . 31 billion francs compared with 2 . 82 billion in 1985 , said its current profits rose by 19 pct last year , without giving further figures .
However , it added in a statement that the company made major capital gains on sales during the year , in particular from the sale of Genstar shares .
Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November ' s annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4 . 5 billion francs , including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco Limited & lt ; IMS . TO >.
He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion francs after a rough balance in 1985 .

U . S . HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST A proposal by two U . S . House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small - and medium - sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today .
" On balance , this is the best new idea I have seen ," said Rep . Dan Glickman ( D - Kan .), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat , Feedgrains and Soybeans .
" This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the ( Reagan ) administration ' s farm proposal .
" The plan , offered by Reps . Tim Penny ( D - Minn .) and Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ), would raise target prices for wheat to 5 . 00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3 . 50 dlrs .
Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30 , 000 bu of corn and 20 , 000 bu of wheat .
The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct , eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits .
Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years , protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted .
However , Rep . Pat Roberts ( R - Kan .) said the measure would " involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is .
" Roberts said the bill , for example , would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas .
Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments .
EC TO MULL NEW DURUM WHEAT INTERVENTION RULES The European Commission is to consider proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat into intervention stores , European Community sources said .
They said a document drawn up by Commission officials proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct from 14 , an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per hectolitre from 76 , a tightening of other technical standards and introduction of some new ones .
Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1 . 15 mln tonnes , of which almost 1 . 12 mln are in Italy .
COURT ENJOINS TENDER FOR BANCROFT & lt ; BTV > Bancroft Convertible Fund said the U . S . District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a preliminary injunction , enjoining & lt ; Zico Investment Holding Inc ' s > tender offer for Bancroft .
It said the Court order prevents Zico from buying any shares tendered to them during the offer , which began on Feb . 17 , 1987 .
In the tender offer blocked by the Court , Zico offered to buy 500 , 000 shares , or about 22 pct of Bancroft ' s outstanding stock , for 30 dlrs a share .
Previously , Zico had bought 965 , 000 Bancroft shares for 31 dlrs a share , giving it about 28 pct of the company .
If the recent offer had gone through , the Zico would have owned slightly more than 50 pct of Bancroft ' s outstanding shares .
ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two - tier exchange rate , central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said .
Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate , decided by the auction , for other types of business .
The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha ' s exchange rate , but these were suspended at the end of January .
President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted .
Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders .
The kwacha stood at 2 . 2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985 , but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later .
Since then , Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar .

TAFT & lt ; TFB > TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW ALTERNATIVES Taft Broadcasting Co said its board continues to explore alternatives , such as a possible financial restructuring , in response to a Theta Corp offer of 150 dlrs per share for Taft stock .
Last week Taft rejected a 145 dlr - a - share bid by Theta , an investment group headed by Taft ' s vice chairman , Dudley Taft .
Taft also said the new proposal would be submitted to the board but no decision had been made with respect to the sale of the company .
In the proposal , Theta said it was prepared to discuss all aspects of the offer including price , structure and form of consideration and would be prepared to negotiate a transaction in which shareholders would receive a value in excess of 150 dlrs per share .
Taft said Theta requested that the company cooperate and provide it with information subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
The company declined to comment beyond this statement .
LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE Two new U . K . Tax relief measures for oil producers , announced today , are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry , the Inland Revenue said in a post - budget statement .
Earlier , Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today , companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ).
To date , full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself , when its income stream began , but was not immediately available against other development expenditure , the statement said .
The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today , and will improve the post - tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed , it said .
Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability .
This means oil - related expenditure in the U . K . Or on the U . K . Continental shelf , which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred , to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field , the Inland Revenue said .
This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures , and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs , it said .
In due course , the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year , it calculated .
The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech .
These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT - exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation .
Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced , while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so - called " ring fence " of activities in the U . K . And its continental shelf .
The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November , it said .
Gareth Lewis Davies , a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh , thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry .
He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey , Don and Arbroath would be brought forward .
Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged , he said .
Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry , which suffered a huge amount of lay - offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year .
He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin .
This means more jobs could be created , as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south .
He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry , although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year .

ATT - PHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED American Telephone and Telegraph Co and Philips Telecommunications BV ( APT ) would hold 36 pct through direct and indirect holdings in France ' s & lt ; Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques > if a joint bid with French partners for the soon - to - be - privatised firm succeeds , a director at one of the partner firms said .
Marc Mathieu of & lt ; Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications > SAT , told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct for APT , the joint firm set up by the U . S .' s ATT & lt ; T . N .> and the NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken & lt ; PGLO . AS >.
The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made up of SAT , APT , Cie du Midi & lt ; MCDP . PA > and five mutual funds .
Under French law , foreign investors are restricted to a 20 pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings .
The make - up of the holding company , however , is subject to close discussions within the government due to legal queries over the nationality of the mutual funds , a Finance Ministry official said .
Although bought by French citizens they are managed by foreign banks & lt ; Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York > and & lt ; Banque de Neuflize , Schlumberger , Mallet SA >, controlled by Algemene Bank Nederland NV & lt ; ABNN . AS >, an SAT spokesman said .
CGCT , which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone switching market , is to be sold by the government for 500 mln francs by private tender .
Five groups are bidding for the company and the government has said it will choose CGCT ' s new owner by the end of April .
APT vice - president Wim Huisman told a news conference a capital increase was envisaged if SAT - APT wins CGCT , but declined to give details or say how an increase would affect foreign stakes in CGCT .
In 1985 , CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs .
A joint SAT - APT statement added that buyers were committed to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production plants .
The APT - SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to produce APT 5ESS - PRX switching technology and adapt it to French standards .
The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction of the French government privatisation laws which reopened bidding among a wider range of applicants .
Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany ' s Siemens AG & lt ; SIEG . F > allied with Schneider SA & lt ; SCHN . PA > subsidiary Jeumont - Schneider , Sweden ' s Telefon AB LM Ericsson & lt ; ERIC . ST > allied with Matra & lt ; MATR . PA > and Bouygues SA & lt ; BOUY .

ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U . K . BASE RATE British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9 - 1 / 2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U . K . Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today ' s 1987 budget , bank analysts said .
The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s budget as cautious , a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward .
Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through , the analysts said .
Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow .
" This is very much a safety - first budget in order to get interest rates down ," he said .
Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut , with the key three month interbank rate down to 9 - 11 / 16 pct from 9 - 13 / 16 last night , and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half - point cut now .
Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he , too , expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday , but this would likely happen via two half - point cuts .
" This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate .
The implications for interest rates are very favourable , we could have a half - point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week ," Simmonds said .
Pointing to buoyant U . K . Retail data released yesterday , he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target .
" There is no real need to boost private consumption ," he said .
National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one - point base rate cut .
Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully , in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut , before a one - point base rate cut could be implemented .
But providing the budget small - print was convincing , " and I suspect it will be , it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week ," Kern said .
Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one - point cut in mortgage lending rates .
This would help achieve Lawson ' s lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end - 1987 , he said .
U . K . Base rates were cut last week to 10 - 1 / 2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange , money and government bonds ( gilts ) markets .
But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point .
TOUSSIE GROUP SELLS HECK ' S & lt ; HEX > SHARES A shareholder group led by New York investor Robert Toussie told the Securities and Exchange Commission it sold off most of its holdings in Heck ' s Inc common stock but reserved the right to again seek control of the company in the future .

DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE , BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen , and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth , a top Bundesbank official said .
Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies " can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium - term perspective .
" He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald " an era of greater exchange rate stability .
" The Paris agreement was not , however , an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates , Gleske stressed , adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level .
" At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen ," Gleske said .
He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada , Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong , and further falls there may still be necessary .
But " a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position , as measured by its weighted external value ," he said .
In fact , a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers , Gleske said .
First , in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany , it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses .
Second , in the United States , it could damage investors ' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits , Gleske said .
Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies , fluctuating in narrow bands against each other , can be established .
Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts , " both within countries and between them .
" For instance , the U . S . Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels , but domestic considerations call for low ones .
If target zones were established , this would put " pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more , even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities ," he said .
Gleske added , " targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities .
" Commenting on the Paris currency accord , Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained .
These chances " seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates , and the monetary policies behind them , will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead .
" Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned " that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot .
" He said this " would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible .
" Monetary policies can help achieve this , but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments , he said .

CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA / NOAA Light , scattered showers covered winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended March 14 , moistening topsoils for wheat , just breaking dormancy in most central and northern areas , the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U . S . Agriculture and Commerce Departments said .
In its International Weather and Crop summary , the agency said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative stage .
Above - normal February temperatures over the North China Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the south .
Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu , Anhui , eastern Hebei , Hunan , Jiangxi , Fujian , and Zheziang , reversed February ' s below normal precipitation pattern .
The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for irrigation .
Mostly dry weather in early - rice areas of Guanxi and Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting , it said .

U . S .
WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House - ordered report said that growing U . S . reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security .
The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil , but makes no recommendations .
President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry .
Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that " although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years , this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports .
" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U . S . consumption and by the mid - 1990s could rise to 50 pct .
Among the report ' s options to ease U . S . reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration .
President Reagan ordered the study last September , citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel , referring to the OPEC - led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s .
The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U . S . oil firms to find and produce new oil , as well as to cut imports , but on the whole the tax would depress the nation ' s economy .

COASTAL ( CGP ) SEES INCREASE IN 1987 PROFITS Coastal Corp said it expected earnings for 1987 " to be significantly above " profits of 71 . 6 mln dlrs last year .
In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company ' s newly - issued 1986 annual report , Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to increase .
The 1986 profits of Coastal , a natural gas production and pipeline company , were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping energy prices .
The company ' s sales totaled 6 . 7 billion dlrs last year .
Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average price of 2 . 17 dlrs per mcf in 1986 , a drop of 18 pct from the previous year .
Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average 14 . 20 dlrs a barrel in 1986 , a reduction of 37 pct .
The Houston - based company , which produced a daily average of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11 , 149 barrels of oil , said it had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28 . 6 mln barrels of oil and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas .

U . S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA - CHAMPLIN DEAL an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp ' s joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela ( pdvsa ), champlin chairman william adams said .
" this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations , but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard ," he told reuters during the signing ceremony here .
Venezuela ' s energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement , under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin ' s corpus christi refinery , as " one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets .
" union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides , combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets .
" we are looking to a long - term relationship , and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U . S . Congress there are clear benefits to both sides ," he said .
Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro - treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield .
" therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations , and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent , we do not foresee any impact on today ' s agreement ," adams said .
He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela ' s bolivar coastal field ( bcf ) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins .
The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110 , 000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude , with an 80 - 85 pct yield of white products .
LYNG TO MEET WITH EXPORTERS , EEP LIKELY TOPIC Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting companies today , and the subject of subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union will likely be discussed , an aide to Lyng said .
Today ' s meeting , set to begin at 1500 EST ( 2000 gmt ), was scheduled at the request of the exporters , the aide said .
" The EEP ( export enhancement program ) is pretty obviously one of the things they ( the exporters ) want to talk about , but they haven ' t any agenda as far as I know ," Lyng ' s aide said .
Private industry export officials have met periodically with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation .
Whether this meeting will prompt any U . S . action on the issue of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is uncertain , the aide said .
" I don ' t know what they ' ll tell us that we don ' t already knwo , but we ' ll hear what they have to say ," Lyng ' s aide said .
The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under the EEP .
ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN The International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon , delegates said .
The plan , presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn , represented a compromise between producer , European Community , EC , and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate , they said .
The proposal involved three key principles .
First , the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously , delegates said .
Under an offer system , the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices , they said .
The second provision was that non - ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock , while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa , to be set by a formula , the delegates said .
After the plan was presented , working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers , EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal .
Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT , producer delegates said .
Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from , one consumer delegate said .
Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change .

GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) opened a two - day meeting to discuss further economic integration , officials said .
They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate .
The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states .
Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year .
The six states have different currency systems .
Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund ' s basket of currencies -- the special drawing right ( SDR ) -- but in practice to the dollar .
Oman links its currency formally to the dollar , while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade - weighted basket devised by itself .
The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed , but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade - weighted basket .
Opening the meeting , Ahmed al - Tayer , the UAE ' s Minister of State for Finance and Industry , said implementation of joint economic agreements " is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together .
" The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain ' s Finance and National Economy Minister , Ibrahim Abdul - Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC .
Officials said the corporation ' s assets rose to 1 . 31 billion dollars last year from 1 . 04 billion at the end of 1985 .

SOUTH AFRICA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA / NOAA Dry weather pushed further into South Africa ' s Orange Free State ' s Maize Triangle in the week ended March 14 , the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U . S . Agriculture and Commerce Departments said .
In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin , the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal , but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south .
Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas , stressing grain - filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall , it said .
The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas , but earlier periods of hot , dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State .

WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA / NOAA Dry weather covered most European crop areas in the week ended March 14 , except for those in southwestern France , southern Italy , and Greece , the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U . S . Agriculture and Commerce Departments said .
In its International Weather and Crop sumary , the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece .
Winter grains in England , France , and northern Italy remained dormant .
Grains usuaually break dormancy in March .
Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April , it said .
Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India , it said .
Normally , wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north , ending in most areas by late April .
Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India , reversing February ' s below - normal trend .
Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas , it said .
In the Philippines , most rainfall was restricted to the central islands , continuing February ' s drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao .
Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands .
In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java , it said .
The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan winter grains , approaching teh heading stage , the agency said .
Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia .
Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria , but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands , it said .
Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained adequate moisture for crop growth , it said .
Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase , the agency said .

ANALYSTS SAY U . K . BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts , if slightly lacking in excitement .
A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow , with most forecasts predicting a half - point fall .
A follow - up half - point cut is anticipated next week .
" Worthy but boring would probably sum it up ," Peter Fellner , U . K .
Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co , said .
" It was a very , very prudent fiscal budget .
" Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well - balanced budget within the confines of the government ' s philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat .
Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side , but offered nothing new on monetary policy .
As was widely expected , Lawson split his " fiscal adjustment " between trimming the 1987 / 88 PSBR target to 4 . 0 billion stg from 7 . 1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct .
The target for the narrow measure of money supply , M0 , was kept unchangd at two to six pct , while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped .
Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half - point fall in U . K . Base rates tomorrow , but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately .
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one - point cut tomorrow .
" The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later ," Jeffrey said , though he added a further half - point cut was quite possible in the near future .
The main worry from today ' s speech is the outlook for inflation , given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it , Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said .
Holt noted the " rather loose " inflation forecast of 4 . 0 pct at end - 1987 , and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern .
" A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term ," he said , although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation .
The Budget will inspire a lot of short - term confidence but it was " not a good budget for inflation ," he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build - up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation .
Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the " leading edge " of monetary policy , but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front .
He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness .
Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts .
Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets , which are already discounting that amount , Jeffrey said .
that the 4 . 0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986 / 87 , which is now also forecast to be 4 . 0 billion stg .
But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear - cut indication about the timing of the general election , which has to be held before June , 1988 .
Some believe it signals a poll this June , noting that the benefits , such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco , become available immediately .
But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it .
James Capel ' s Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent , Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no " chickens coming home to roost .
" Richard Jeffrey , who favours the likelihood of a June election , said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory .
Nevertheless , he said , it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party ' s pre - election popularity .
TAFT & lt ; TFB > STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company .
However , several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover .
" There are too many uncertainties ," said one arbitrager .
Taft stock rose 2 - 7 / 8 to 155 - 3 / 4 .
Dudley Taft , Taft vice chairman , and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board , stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share .
The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors , but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company .
" Someone ' s betting this company will go for 170 ( dlrs per share )," said one arbitrager .
Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels , unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range .
They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites .
Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1 . 35 billion dlr bid from the investment group .
The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman , Sachs and Co , its financial adviser .
It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring .
Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft , which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner , chairman of American Financial Corp .
The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16 . 2 pct .
The Taft family , which founded the company almost 50 years ago , has about 12 pct .
Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft .
" I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 ( dlrs per share )," said one arbitrager , but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s .
Another speculated that Lindner might bid , but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company .
Lindner was unavailable for comment .
Dennis McAlpine , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co , said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout .
" Ideally , you ' d have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved ," he said , adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft .
He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share , but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160 .
He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry .
BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP The Bank of France expects a continued revival in short - term industrial activity , but the outlook for any improvement in France ' s record 10 . 9 pct unemployment rate remains bleak , the Bank of France said in its monthly review .
The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the agro - food sector in February more than compensated for the fall in January , while construction and civil engineering experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the next few months .
Internal demand rose and the export situation improved , in particular toward the European Community ( EC ), the Bank said .
Stocks decreases and order book levels , with the exception of the agro - food industry , improved substantially .
In addition , retail prices and salaries stabilised last months .
Production rose in all sectors except agricultural machinery and aeronautics , where it stabilised , and ship construction , where it declined .
The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in activity in February , with both domestic and export orders rising .
In the consumer goods sector , actitity rose sharply despite a fall in the household goods sector and stability in pharmaceuticals .
Among semi - finished products , output rose sharply , helped by a strong growth in construction materials .
But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over the past two months .
HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY RECOMMEND TAX BENEFITS FOR U . S . OIL INDUSTRY
HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY RECOMMEND TAX BENEFITS FOR U . S . OIL INDUSTRY
HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U . S . dependence on foreign oil .
He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35 , 000 barrels per day .
The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100 , 000 barrels a day .
Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve , but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints .
Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate , but U . S . officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce .
He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department ' s study on oil ' s impact on national security .
Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make , he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy .
He said he would like to increase U . S . production by one mln barrels a day .
The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption , posing a serious economic and national security threat .

U . S .
WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House - ordered report said that growing U . S . reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security .
The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil , but makes no recommendations .
President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry .
Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that " although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years , this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports .
" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U . S . consumption and by the mid - 1990s could rise to 50 pct .
Among the report ' s options to ease U . S . reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration .
President Reagan ordered the study last September , citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel , referring to the OPEC - led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s .
The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U . S . oil firms to find and produce new oil , as well as to cut imports , but on the whole the tax would depress the nation ' s economy .
The study was outlined in a New York Times report today .

OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel , OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al - Wattari said today .
In a speech to a European Community ( EC )/ OAPEC / OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here , Al - Wattari said : " OPEC believes ... The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs .
" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries , who had been forced to curtail production , and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases .
" For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel , its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production ," Al - Wattari said .
" Such cutbacks ...
Cannot , in certain cases , be sustained ," Al - Wattari said .
As well as financial and marketing pressures , some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies , he added .
Al - Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization ' s agreed ceiling for all member countries in February , although this had meant sacrifices .
The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability , though restored to a good level , was still under pressure , Al - Wattari said .
" A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation ," he added .
He said some non - OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC .
But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC , they were insufficient in terms of volume , he added .
" The overall majority of non - OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC ' s calls for supply regulation ," he said .
Al - Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue , while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high - cost areas outside OPEC .
Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures , he added .
Fadhil Al - Chalabi , OPEC Deputy Secretary General , also addressing the seminar , added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market .
Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides , Al - Chalabi said , adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full - fledged Euro - Arab dialogue .

VENEZUELA - ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50 , 000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage , a senior Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) official said .
" We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected ," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today .
He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador ' s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite .
He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered .
Venezuela , possibly unique among oil exporters , requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market .
Ecuador ' s oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador ' s account and remit the revenues to Quito .
Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35 , 000 bpd .
He said Venezuela ' s oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe , but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil .

SURALCO ALUMINA EXPORTS DROPPED 75 PCT IN FEB The Surinam Aluminum Company ( SURALCO ) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in February after its operations were shut down by worker violence and guerrilla sabotage , the official Surinam News Agency , SNA , reported .
SNA said Suralco ' s alumina exports dropped to 23 , 869 tonnes in February from 92 , 852 tonnes in January .
Aluminum exports , meanwhile , decreased nine pct in the same period , to 1 , 511 tonnes from 1 , 647 tonnes .
Suralco ' s alumina refinery at Paranam , 18 miles south of the capital , was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the company ' s nearby aluminum smelter .
The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti - government guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit power to the plant from the Afobaka dam .
The alumina refinery , owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton NV , a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary , was reopened March 9 .
But the smelter remains closed , as do the Suralco mines at Moengo , 60 miles east of Paramaribo , which were closed down by guerrillas last November .
U . S . HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH Surprisingly strong U . S . housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth , economists said .
Building was boosted by two factors last month , unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates .
But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy , if any , will come from housing in coming months .
And after a steady retreat , mortgage rates seem to be near bottom .
U . S . housing starts rose 2 . 6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 . 851 mln units from 1 . 804 mln in January .
It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986 .
The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4 . 4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 . 764 mln units after dropping 11 . 52 pct to 1 . 690 mln in January .
" February ' s weather is usually more adverse for home building .
Because of seasonal factors it ' s difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road ," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp .
The housing report is seasonally - weighted to compensate for weather - related setbacks .
As a result , milder temperatures inflate the statistics .
Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month .
But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring / early summer .
" Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying ' Let ' s do it now '," said Mark Obrinsky of the U . S . League of Savings Institutions in Washington , whose members supply much of the financing for home building .
But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U . S . economy .
He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9 . 50 pct fixed rate effective in February .
Last November , fixed rate mortgages were about 10 . 30 pct .
As expected , the strength in housing was concentrated in the single - family sector .
The multi - family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1 .
Single - family starts rose at a 5 . 6 pct annual pace to 1 . 317 mln units .
Multi - family fell 4 . 1 pct to a 534 , 000 rate .
" Strength in the single - family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job .
But we ' re probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential ," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
McCarthy noted that the housing report , together with larger than expected gains in U . S . employment , industrial output and retail sales in February , may cause some observers to start waving " four pct GNP banners " for the first quarter .
Gross national product grew 1 . 3 pct in the fourth quarter .
But McCarthy , who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2 . 5 pct or slightly above , is not convinced that growth will pick up in future .
" The big story is the inventory re - building that ' s going on now , not all of which is intentional ," he said .
For example , U . S . automakers , who are already saddled with high stocks , produced at an annual rate of 8 . 3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7 . 3 mln .
Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter , they may result in scaled - back production and weaker growth in the second , he said .
" If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand , then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter ," agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp .
He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects .
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed .
" At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter , we could foresee production slowing in the second ," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy , Crisanti and Maffei Inc , who expects first quarter growth of about three pct .

U . K . OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987 / 88 The U . K . Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987 / 88 , from 4 . 75 billion in 1986 / 87 and 11 . 5 billion in 1985 / 86 .
The forecast came in the Treasury ' s Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s annual budget statement to parliament .
The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel , in line with its earlier forecasts , and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels , the Treasury document said .
The Treasury said the 1987 / 88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986 , as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag .
The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year , and 400 mln stg in a full year .
Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987 , according to the statement .
A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987 / 88 and 50 mln stg in a full year , it added .
Total general government receipts for 1986 / 87 are now estimated to be 159 . 2 billion stg , 2 . 75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts , despite a shortfall of 1 . 25 billlion in oil receipts .
Additional non - North Sea corporation tax of 1 . 75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot .
Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168 . 8 billion stg in fiscal 1987 / 88 , and among the main items , besides diminishing oil revenues , were projected income tax of 40 billion stg , up from 38 . 4 billion in the current year .
Non - North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13 . 5 billion stg in 1987 / 88 , after the revised 11 . 2 billion in 1986 / 87 , and VAT revenue should amount to 23 . 3 billion , compared with upwardly revised estimated 21 . 5 billion this fiscal year .
The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173 . 5 billion stg , up from a revised 164 . 9 billion in the current year .
A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations ' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3 . 9 billion stg in 1987 / 88 , from this year ' s revised 4 . 1 billion , the Treasury said .
REYNOLD METALS & lt ; RLM > UP ON FURMAN SELZ REPORT Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rose sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings potential from the company ' s Australian gold holding , traders familiar with the report said .
Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share this year and 1 . 40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988 .
Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59 - 5 / 8 on volume of 729 , 500 shares .
Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and the Boddington gold project , both located in Australia .
An analyst familiar with the two mines said " the properties , together , have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share for Reynolds .
" The analyst , who asked not to be identified , said the rise in the stock today was likely the result of " U . S . investors that were not completely cognizant of the size or the importance of the ( Reynolds ') holdings in Australia .
" Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine .
Boddington is principally a bauxite mine .
The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington .
Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings estimates , expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4 . 10 dlr a share in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988 .
Last year , Reynolds reported net earnings of 8 . 18 dlrs a share , which included 3 . 09 dlrs a share for adoption of new accounting rules , 1 . 01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards and other extraordinary items .

OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel , OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al - Wattari said .
In a speech to a European Community / OAPEC / OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here , Al - Wattari said , " OPEC believes ... the world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs .
" Al - Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization ' s agreed ceiling for all member countries in February , although this had meant sacrifices .
The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability , though restored to a good level , was still under pressure , Al - Wattari said .
" A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation ," he said .
U . S . HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0 / 92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant .
The one - time pilot 0 / 92 program , designed to assist farmers in Kansas , Oklahoma , Michigan and parts of Missouri , was passed by a 304 - 100 vote and sent to the Senate .
Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 / 92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration , the U . S . Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure .
USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration ' s proposed broad - scale revision of farm programs .
The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received .
To be eligible , winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring , although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay .
USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs , largely because of reduced crop forfeitures .
The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall ' s flooding .
In addition , the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall .
Currently , because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds , USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses .
The administration said it opposed the bill because , by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief , it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance .
USDA also said the 0 / 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration ' s proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings .
USDA said the 0 / 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs , while the requirement to compensate fully disaster - struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs , which must be appropriated by Congress .
The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs .
USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs .
In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments .
But the Senate bill would not offer the 0 / 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 - mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program .

HEINZ & lt ; HNZ > POISED FOR RECORD YEAR H . J .
Heinz Co is " within sight of our 22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth " for the fiscal year ending April 30 , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Anthony O ' Reilly told investment analysts .
O ' Reilly , who declined to make a specific projection , said the food company is " stronger than at any time in its 118 - year history .
" Last week Heinz reported third - quarter earnings rose to 55 cts a share from 46 cts a share .
Sales rose to 1 . 08 billion dlrs from 1 . 01 billion dlrs a year earlier .
O ' Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big brands , new products and services , new geography , internal growth and acquisitions .
He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in history , 55 pct .
But in response to a question , the executive said a volume falloff in the overall product category " is a concern to us .
" O ' Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln dlrs .
O ' Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to build a second plant in China , where it entered a joint venture with the government in 1984 , forming Heinz - UFE Ltd , which produces dry baby food cereal .
He said Heinz - Japan is " making a profit and generating its first substantial dividends ," and implementation of a new partnership , Seoul - Heinz Ltd , is moving ahead with a new manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul , South Korea .
To increase its competitiveness , O ' Reilly said Heinz implemented a " lowest cost imaginable " program targeted at manufacturing , sales and marketing and procurement .
He said a modernization program is in effect at the company ' s United Kingdom operations , where the labor force , trimmed to 4 , 000 from 10 , 000 , is expected to be further reduced to 2 , 500 in 1988 .
ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE & lt ; ABEV > EXPLORES UNIT SALE Allegheny Beverage Corp said it has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its foodservice unit , Service America Corp .
The group includes senior management of Service America but no officers of Allegheny Beverage , the company said .
The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America , it said .
Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary .
The company said the group ' s review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or , if made , accepted .
Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln dlrs , or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage ' s total revenues of 1 . 13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29 , 1986 , a spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said .
He declined to identify the Service America officials in the acquisition group .
On Feb 18 , 1987 , Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin off of Service America , but gave no reason for doing so .
It said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit .
Service America , which Allegheny acquired in May 1985 , operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines .
Through other subsidiaries , Allegheny provides coin - operated laundry services , building maintenance services and retail office and furniture operations .
In fiscal 1986 , Allegheny reported earnings from continuing operations of 8 . 2 mln dlrs or 1 . 09 dlrs a fully diluted share , excluding income of 59 . 7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and an extraordinary loss of 8 . 1 mln dlrs .

PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT peru will sell about 40 state - owned firms to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among government - owned companies .
Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially , according to jose palomino , president of the government ' s state company holding firm , the national development council ( conade ).
He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis .
He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies .
Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987 , against the govenment target of 40 - 50 pct .
Palomino said aeroperu , the government flagship airline with a 10 - jet fleet , would issue stock for purchase by private investors .
The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years , earning about 44 . 6 mln intis in pre - tax profits .
Peru has about 140 non - financial state firms .
Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold , including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange .
Last november , palomino said conade ' s plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances .
Shares could also be sold in a copper mine , empresa nacional tintaya sa , in the southern state of arequipa .
Neither Palomino nor conade ' s general manager , enrique estremadoyro , were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies .
Their secretaries said they were out of their offices .
Jose antonio almenara , the general manager of the lima stock exchange , where shares of the state - owned firms could be sold , told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase stock at the exchange had to be tax - paying residents of peru .
He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad until at least july 1988 .

UK TRADE WARY OF HIGHER EC GRAIN LEVY The European Community may decide to increase the cereals co - responsibility levy and extend its scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission ' s 1987 / 88 farm price package is opposed by member states , Edgar Pye , vice - president of the British agricultural merchants ' association UKASTA , said .
At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye , addressing a feed manufacturers ' dinner in Glasgow , said this could change if its controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils and fats tax are blocked Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy " tooth and nail .
" However , a test case in the European Court of Justice contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the levy , which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers ' organisation FEFAC , was not now expected to be heard until the end of 1987 , he said .

U . S .
CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT / CORN SUPPLIES From April through December 1986 , the Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) issued 3 . 85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1 . 8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1 , 1987 , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
The department said an additional 4 . 3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January - August , 1987 .
These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year , the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report .
Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U . S . grain more competitive on world markets , it said .
The department said last summer , for example , certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn .
This helped increase marketable supplies , so farm - level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise .
The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels , it said .
The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986 ' s 25 . 8 billion dlrs .
During 1988 and 1989 , the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980 ' s will reverse .
If current policy remains in force , annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year ' s record by more than eight billion dlrs , it said .
The department said the President ' s budget proposals for 1988 - 1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs .
In 1987 , foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2 . 6 pct , the same as in 1986 , but above the 2 . 4 pct average of 1980 - 86 , it said .
Partially because of this improvement , U . S . export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years , the department said .
SENATOR SAYS ENERGY REPORT ASSUMPTIONS FLAWED Sen . Pete Domenici , a main sponsor of legislation to set an oil import fee , said the administration ' s energy security report was based on flawed economic assumptions .
The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into account the last few weeks ' drop in domestic oil production in its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers .
The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the fee would reduce tax revenues .
" A five dlr ( per barrel ) oil import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and investment , " and raise revenues , he said .
FARM PROGRAM CHANGES OUTLINED BY USDA OFFICIAL Upcoming changes being considered in the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s transportation and loan programs were outlined by a USDA official today .
Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association , Tom VonGarlem , assistant deputy administrator for USDA ' s state and county operations , said the following changes are under consideration by USDA .
Termination of USDA ' s Transportation Assistance Program for wheat , barley and sorghum would be proposed this week .
Changes in USDA ' s reserve rotation program are also under consideration , VonGarlem said .
While the department has not made any final decision , banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration , he said .
Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year ' s crop , he said , with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration .
VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup , saying he sees no reason to do so at this time .
He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program .
USDA OFFICIAL SEES 7 - 8 BILLION DLRS CERTIFICATES There will be seven to eight billion dlrs of generic certificates on the market by the end of harvest , an Agriculture Department official said .
The Commodity Credit Corp will " depend heavily " on certificates to relieve storage problems this year , Ralph Klopfenstein , Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations , USDA , told participants at the National Grain and Feed Association ' s annual convention .
Klopfenstein said that CCC will not be able to relocate grain in any significant amount this fall , so certificates will be used in various programs to relieve storage tightness .
Klopfenstein said certificates meet the goal of allowing prices to go below loan levels and providing USDA with an inventory management tool .
MAJOR U . S . FARM GROUPS OPPOSE POLICY CHANGES Seven major U . S . farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law .
Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza ( D - Tex .
) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt .), the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should " resist efforts to overhaul the 15 - month - old law , which is operating in its first crop marketing year .
" The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation , American Soybean Association , National Cattlemen ' s Association , National Corn Growers Association , National Cotton Council , National Pork Producers Council and the U . S . Rice Producers Legislative Group .
The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill " so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income .
" " We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions ," the groups said .

CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program , eep , subsidies to the Soviet Union .
Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee , Roberts said the U . S . has offered eep to China and Poland , and should also include the Soviet Union .
Rep . Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country .
" That very well may be the case ," said Tom Kay , U . S . Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator .
However , Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge .
Rep . Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow .
" I ' d be delighted to deliver the message ," Kay replied .
Earlier , Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng ' s statement last week that " the door is not yet closed on an eep to the Soviet Union .

LYNG SAID TO HAVE NO COMMENT ON USSR WHEAT EEP U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a position to comment on their request that the Reagan administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union , according to participants in today ' s meeting .
" He ( Lyng ) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP ( export enhancement program ) initiative to the Soviet Union ," said Glen Hofer , vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives .
Another participant in the meeting , who asked not to be identified , said Lyng was " unresponsive " to the group ' s request .
Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc , Continental Grain Co , Louis Dreyfus Corp , Union Equity Cooperative Exchange , the National Association of Wheat Growers , the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives , among others , participants said .
Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30 - minute meeting .
Hofer described Lyng as " sympathetic but noncommittal ," and said he thought he detected " a sense of frustration " on Lyng ' s part at not being able to respond more positively to the group ' s urging .
A grain industry representative said some participants were " puzzled " by USDA ' s apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets .
" There is a feeling that there is more receptivity ( to the idea ) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been ," this official , who asked not to be identified , said , referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets .
This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow .
Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt .) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer , this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject .
But Hofer said other important matters at the White House , rather than an absence of political pressure , might have restrained Lyng .
PAPERBOARD PLANS BID TO ACQUIRE BELKIN & lt ; Paperboard Industries Corp > said it planned to make an unconditional 21 dlr a share cash offer for & lt ; Belkin Inc >' s 7 . 6 mln common and 2 . 3 mln non - voting shares .
Paperboard said Balaclava Enterprises Ltd , owned by Morris Belkin , agreed to tender 98 . 2 pct of Belkin ' s common shares .
It added that in case of a competing offer of more than 23 dlrs , it had the right to match it .
If it did not match the offer , Balaclava could accept the competing bid .
The two companies manufacture linerboard and boxboard from recycled fibre .
Their combined revenues are about 500 mln dlrs .

PAPER SAYS U . S . MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS The Reagan administration will consider curbing foreign takeovers of security - sensitive industries such as semiconductors and computers , the New York Times said , quoting an unnamed senior administration official .
" I think there ' s a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs ," the paper quoted the official as saying .
" Two of the most visible ( industries ) are semiconductor and computer companies ," said the official , who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan ' s Fujitsu Ltd & lt ; ITSU . T > takeover bid for & lt ; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp >.
The Fairchild - Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday , and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry .
Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French - controlled Schlumberger Ltd & lt ; SLB > to Japan ' s largest computer maker because it could have left the U . S . Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology .
The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security - sensitive areas .
" Everybody wants an open investment policy , but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest ," Baldrige was quoted as saying .
The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top - level interagency policymaking group , such as Treasury Secretary James Baker ' s Economic Policy Council or the president ' s National Security Council .
YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN ' S FAVOURITE HORROR " Endaka ," the strong yen , has usurped " Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster " as Japan ' s favourite horror story .
The yen ' s 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon , the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15 , 000 dlrs a month .
But " endaka ," like many Japanese products , is for foreign consumption , locals and long - time foreign residents said .
" It ' s not really that expensive .
I don ' t pay attention to the cost of living ," said Cheryl Richmond , a 25 - year - old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo .
Richmond said she earns 1 , 635 dlrs a month by " chatting " 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language .
For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny , quiet two - room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku , one of Tokyo ' s prime business and entertainment districts , and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month .
She spends less than 6 . 50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day .
" For lunch I buy the teishoku ( daily special ) which comes with soba ( buckwheat noodles ) or pork cutlet , pickles , miso soup , rice and tea ," although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner .
No one argues that Tokyo is cheap , but long - time residents see no need to spend the 2 , 000 to 15 , 000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western - style homes .
The companies feel otherwise .
They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan ' s increasingly lucrative markets .
" You can ' t expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down .
It ' s not reasonable ," said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp ( IBM ), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo .
Tokyo is the world ' s most expensive city for business travellers , a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said .
It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day .
While the businessmen have little choice but to come here , many tourists , especially those from Europe , are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia .
The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates " endaka " caused an 11 . 5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year .
Those who came tried to cut back on expenses , chiefly by curtailing shopping , it said .
To help combat " endaka " and the slump in tourism , the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet , " Economical Travel in Japan .
" It gives budget - saving tips on finding medium - priced business hotels and Japanese - style inns , cheap sushi and public baths while getting a " revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives .
" Residents of Okubo House , a transit hotel in Tokyo ' s Shin - Okubo love hotel district , offer even more savvy advice .
For 9 . 80 dlrs a night , Scott Perry , a 23 - year - old budding English teacher from New Zealand , shares an unheated , berth - sized twin - room in the Japanese " flop house .
" Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work .
" Normally I eat ' teishoku ' for 400 yen but sometimes I ' ll splurge at Shakey ' s where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours .
" Still , there are the extras that dent the budget .
" I had to spend 600 yen today to dry - clean my suit coat ," he said .
BANGLADESH PURCHASE OF WHEAT CONFIRMED Trade sources here confirmed earlier tentative reports that Bangladesh had bought 200 , 000 tonnes of optional origin feed wheat late last week and over the weekend .
They said the Continental Grain Co , of the United States , won the contract to supply the wheat from the EC and other parts of Europe .
It will supply 100 , 000 tonnes at a rate of 96 . 92 U . S . Dlrs a tonne as a first consignment by April 7 .
It will supply the remaining 100 , 000 tonnes at a rate of 93 . 42 dlrs by April 16 .
PHILIPPINES SOCIAL SECURITY TO BUY SAN MIGUEL SHRS The Philippines ' Social Security System ( SSS ) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer & lt ; San Miguel Corp > ( SMC ), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del Rosario said .
He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC ' s 15 - man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos , assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share .
The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank ( UCPB ) and sequestered by the government .
The block is split between class A and class B stock .
SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A . N .
Soriano Corp , the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano , del Rosario said .
The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices .
Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers .
He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares .
President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares .
Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government .
The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco , the former chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos .

Indonesia imports palm oil to counter possible May shortage , Trade Minister says
Indonesia imports palm oil to counter possible May shortage , Trade Minister says
INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL , FEARS MAY SHORTAGE Indonesia has issued licences to traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May , Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters .
" We have given permission for a small amount of imports to prevent a shortage during Ramadan ," he said .
He gave no figures for the amount of palm oil to be imported , but said it would come from Malaysia .
Indonesia , the world ' s second largest palm oil producer , earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences .
Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135 , 000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April .
Indonesia , with 168 mln people , is the world ' s largest Moslem country .
During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and have large meals after sunset .
Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of 1986 were 469 , 100 tonnes , according to central bank figures , against 652 , 000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985 .
Indonesia is expanding palm oil output , and Saleh did not explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan .
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS More U . S . And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas , according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters .
Already , rich Japanese companies have pounced on U . S . Banks , steel and other businesses .
In the latest attempt , Fujitsu Ltd & lt ; ITSU . T > -- Japan ' s biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for & lt ; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp >, a U . S .
Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers .
Nomura Securities Co Ltd & lt ; NMSC . T > and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd & lt ; DSEC . T >, Japan ' s two largest brokerage firms , are seeking a niche in the U . S . And European securities markets , while the country ' s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking , the takeover specialists said .
Major trading houses , which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade , all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists .
Among manufacturers , car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore .
" The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses , especially in the U . S . -- Japan ' s largest market and where political risks are minimal ," a takeover specialist at one trading company said .
Japanese companies have become among the world ' s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months .
But the yen ' s strength , which has also raised the costs of Japan ' s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets , has frozen Japanese corporate growth , the specialists said .
Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports .
Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work .
Domestic interest rates , now at record lows , offer little investment opportunity .
" Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous , but the recent economic factors have become a driving force ," said a banking industry source .
So far , though , the Japanese are being cautious .
While mergers and acquisitions among U . S . Firms number in the thousands , Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen , one merchant banker said .
Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now , but that time span appeared now to be too long .
Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now , he said .
A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc ' s & lt ; DIAC . T > takeover bid for & lt ; Sun Chemical Corp > of the U . S . Last year , which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile , he added .
Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical ' s graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year , after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company .
Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts - related businesses .
Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese , the trading company official says .
" Japanese people don ' t like fighting .
They prefer peaceful amicable deals .
" But now after some experience overseas , Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice , he adds .
" This is a healthy progression .
" However , the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U . S . Or European concerns .
" Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U . S . Or European corporation ," one banker said .
" They will expand their operations only gradually , a typical way for Japanese business .
" A foreign merchant banker also noted , " There are not many mega - deals left to do in the United States .
A lot of the big deals there have already been done .
" But medium - size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies , the specialists said .
Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high - technology areas .
" Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend ," one takeover specialist said .
Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions .
If these succeed , activity could build , the specialists said .
But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins .
Already , they said , Japanese trading houses , long - term credit and commercial banks , brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go - betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves .

KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al - Khalifa al - Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13 - nation group .
Sheikh Ali told Kuwait ' s daily al - Anba " All OPEC states , without exception , are producing within the quotas allocated to them .
Some of them are producing less .
" Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates , which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September , was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year .
Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota , but an earthquake early this month stopped that .
Iraq has rejected its quota , but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell .
OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7 . 25 pct to 15 . 8 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1 .

LAWSON EXPECTS INTEREST RATE FALL SOON U . K . Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he expected British interest rates to fall soon in response to his fiscal 1987 / 88 budget , but he did not say by how much .
" I would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates ," Lawson said in a radio interview .
Analysts said they foresaw U . K . Base rates falling as early as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawson ' s announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing requirement in fiscal 1987 / 88 and 1988 / 89 was to fall to 1 . 0 pct of GDP , or some four billion stg .
British banks ' base lending rates fell a half percentage point on March 9 to the current 10 . 5 pct .
THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates , banking sources said .
They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market .
Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates , they said .
Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0 . 50 to 0 . 75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand , the sources said .
Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986 .
The current gross 7 . 25 pct interest rate for one - year fixed bank deposit and the 11 . 5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade .
Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively .
Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth .
The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3 . 8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits .
Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week .
The Securities Exchange of Thailand ( SET ) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years , shooting up 4 . 57 points to a new seven - year high of 223 . 02 .
Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market .
Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital .
If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date , many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct .
Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market .
CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd & lt ; CAPH . HK > forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year - earlier period .
The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987 but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co & lt ; BA . N > 747 freighter and one Boeing 747 - 300 passenger plane in September and November respectively after it took a 747 - 300 last month .
It earlier reported a 58 . 7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1 . 23 billion H . K .
Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share .
But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124 . 9 mln dlrs from 44 . 4 mln a year .
A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986 .
However , the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing .
It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4 . 59 dlrs a gallon from 6 . 76 dlrs in 1985 .
Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4 . 2 mln last year , up from 3 . 85 in 1985 , with the passengers kilometre travelled rising to 14 . 02 billion from 12 . 56 billion .
But passenger load factor was down to 69 . 1 pct from 71 . 0 pct .
The airline ' s cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in total tonnage over the previous year and a 35 . 9 pct rise in revenue to 1 . 79 billion dlrs .
Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April , 1986 and is now 50 . 23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd & lt ; SWPC . HK >, 16 . 43 pct by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp & lt ; HKBH . HK > and 12 . 5 pct by & lt ; China International Trust and Investment Corp >.

GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON Global trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange ( LIFFE ) and the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ), bond managers said .
" Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures ," said Katsuyuki Okayasu , general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd ' s bond division .
" But Tokyo - based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market ," said Tetsuya Dezuka , deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd , one of the most active yen bond brokers in London .
Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there , dealers said .
Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140 , 000 billion yen , with most held in Japan , they said .
An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U . S . Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago , enabling a continuous 12 - hour session , bond managers here said , adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind .
LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan ' s Finance Ministry last December .
But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets , dealers said .
Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen , but the extent of investor - linked transactions is unknown , securities bond managers said .
" Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London , suggesting they increasingly are engaging in , not only fund raising , but management there ," Dezuka said .
The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U . S . And U . K .
Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market ' s growth , dealers said .
Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year , securities managers said .
The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract , they said .
The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country .
Fundamental Brokers Inc , a major U . S .
Brokers ' broker , has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April .
CBOT ' s start of an evening session , planned for the end of April , will also multiply yen bond futures trading , a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said .
But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market .
" Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE ," said Koki Chiyojima , deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd ' s bond administration division .
Nikko Securities Co Ltd , one of the big four Japanese securities houses , is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters .
Japan ' s Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September , or June and December from April 1 , matching futures delivery months .
The ministry now pays coupons in January , June , July and December .
When delivery months and coupon payments do not match , a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non - resident bond holders , a deterrent to LIFFE , securities managers said .
LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen , bond managers said .
These bonds will be used for deliveries , as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates , they said .
Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues , making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987 .

U . K . MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1 . 1 billion stg .
Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U . K . Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market .
Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today , possibly of one point , following yesterday ' s budget in which the U . K . Public sector borrowing target for 1987 / 88 was slashed by three billion stg .
Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take - up of treasury bills will drain some 1 . 11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers ' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively .

TOYOTA MOTORS SIGNS PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PNB The state - owned Philippine National Bank ( PNB ) will fund Toyota Motor Corp ' s & lt ; TOYO . T > planned purchase of its bankrupt former local partner ' s manufacturing facilities for at least 193 mln pesos , a bank official told reporters .
Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner .
It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the manufacture of car spare parts and other items , and generate about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years .
The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over by state - owned banks .
Official sources said Toyota ' s application was likely to be approved .
Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20 years , & lt ; Delta Motor Corp >, in 1984 because the local company was suffering financial difficulties .
PNB later foreclosed on Delta ' s assets .
BANK OF ENGLAND INVITES BORROWING AT 10 PCT The Bank of England said it had invited those discount houses wishing to use borrowing facilities to do so at 1430 GMT today at a rate of 10 pct for 14 days .
This compares with the Bank ' s present band one dealing rate of 10 - 3 / 8 pct .
The Bank of England ' s announcement was quickly followed by Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank which announced a half - point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10 - 1 / 2 pct .
Dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely expected following yesterday ' s U . K . Budget in which Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced a three billion stg cut in the Government ' s public sector borrowing target for 1987 / 88 to four billion stg .
Many in the market had expected a full one point cut in base rates today but some were not surprised by the authorities ' caution , dealers added .

VEBA SHARE PLACEMENT STILL EXPECTED THIS MONTH The sale of the government ' s 25 . 55 pct stake in VEBA AG & lt ; VEBG . F > is still expected this month , banking sources closely linked with the transaction said .
A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had yet been set for the privatisation , which the government has tabled for the second half of March .
However , he added a scandal at Volkswagen AG & lt ; VOWG . F >, VW , over currency losses " has nothing to do " with the timing of the VEBA sale .
Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of the Federal government ' s stake in VW , originally scheduled for later this year , may be delayed because of the currency affair .
A banker involved in the VEBA placement said " Nothing has changed in the planning .
I still presume that it will take place in the second half of March .
" This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days .
He added that the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its preparatory work , although the price had not been decided .
The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market .
SOVIET ECONOMIST SAYS PRODUCTION FIGURES PADDED A leading Soviet economist said the practice of padding figures was significantly inflating the country ' s industrial production data .
" According to the information of state monitoring organs , the padding of figures makes up one - and - a - half to three per cent of the volume of production ," Alexei Sergeyev told the official newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya .
" In my opinion , it is significantly higher ," Sergeyev , who works at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union ' s Academy of Sciences , said .
Most Western economists have for years allowed for a certain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics for industrial production .
Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually in raw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for work which was not in fact performed .
He said the elimination of figure - padding and other malpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay for the Soviet Union ' s social development program up to the year 2000 .
SONY FORESEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN EARNINGS Sony Corp & lt ; SNE . T > group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen , if the yendollar rate remains at the present level , managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference .
Sony will have an irregular five - month business term ending March 31 , as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end .
Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen , down five pct from a year earlier , he said .
The company earlier reported net income of 7 . 65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31 , down 59 . 2 pct from a year earlier , on sales of 343 . 06 billion , down 6 . 3 pct .
The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen ' s recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad .
The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar , reducing the company ' s total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen , Hashimoto said .
Sales of 8 - mm video camera / recorders totalled 300 , 000 units in the three months , unchanged from a year earlier , while Beta - format video tape recorders ( vtrs ) sales fell to 300 , 000 from 350 , 000 .
Sales of compact disc players rose to 450 , 000 from 300 , 000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2 . 25 mln from 1 . 30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950 , 000 from one mln due to lower exports to China .
Sales of 8 - mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta - format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986 , Hashimoto said .
Overseas sales accounted for 68 . 2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71 . 3 pct a year earlier .
Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct .
Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five - month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen , down 33 pct from a year earlier , on sales of 400 billion , down 12 pct .
Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985 / 86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987 , he added .
The company made 41 . 9 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986 , down 42 . 6 pct from a year earlier , on sales of 1 , 325 billion , down 6 . 7 pct .
KLM DENIES PRESS REPORT OF AIR ATLANTA TAKEOVER NV KLM Royal Dutch Airlines & lt ; KLM . AS > is " absolutely not " negotiating a takeover of U . S .
Regional carrier Air Atlanta , a KLM spokeswoman said in a comment on an article in the leading Dutch evening paper NRC Handelsblad .
" U . S . Law requires that at least 75 pct of shares in a U . S .
Airline be owned by American firms or persons ," the spokeswoman added .
The newspaper said that Air Atlanta , which flies to 11 U . S . Cities , has a fleet of five Boeing jets with passenger capacity of 110 and employs 400 people , is making losses .

The KLM spokeswoman said she expected further announcements about the talks with Vendex to be made early next week .
BELGIAN BANK SAID TO SEE SLOWER GROWTH An internal report produced by the Belgian National Bank foresees the country ' s gross national product growth falling in 1987 to 1 . 0 pct from 2 . 3 pct in 1986 , the independent newspaper Le Soir said .
A National Bank spokesman said the newspaper article was basically correct , but that the report was produced six weeks ago and figures were therefore to some extent out of date .
The government ' s planning bureau predicted growth of 0 . 9 pct this year in a study published last month .

LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING , BACKS LATEST RATE CUT Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today ' s announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct .
However , he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U . K . Interest rates , although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly .
He told a briefing of economic journalists that " I don ' t think we should rush anything .
" Lawson stressed the themes of " gradualism and steadiness " as economic policy .
Lawson acknowledged that today ' s fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987 / 88 , unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement ( PSBR ) of 1 . 0 pct of GDP .
Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates , both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines , were " perfectly consistent " with monetary conditions now in Britain .
He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was " safely inside " its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986 / 87 and 1987 / 88 .
In his budget , Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3 .
Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System ( EMS ), Lawson repeated that " it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election .
" He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review .
But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government .
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U . K . Economy .
But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls .
Although Lawson denounced what he said was " the current wave of election fever " in Britain , he added : " It is more likely that there will be an election this year " than not .
He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air .
" Ideally , we ( the government ) should have a full term ," but events could force a premature poll , Lawson said .
The government , which has been in power since 1979 , must call an election by June 1988 .
Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election , political sources said .
The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987 / 88 " was the right balance , economically and politically ," he said .
Lawson ' s decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two - pence surprised many analysts , who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move .
But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which , while advancing towards that aim , could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate .
Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7 . 1 billion stg for 1986 / 87 -- by some three billion stg .
Returning to changing levels of interest rates , Lawson stressed that " they are not an objective ( for the government ) - they are an instrument of policy .
" Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels , he said .
But " there may be interest rate consequences " from changes in the level of government borrowing , he added .
Lawson said he did not think that the U . K .' s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain .
He said conditions created by London ' s role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries .
Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain , Lawson said .
First , control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone , due to the freedom of its financial markets .
He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party .
Thirdly , he said " we do not have as long a track record of low inflation " as did the U . S ., Japan and West Germany .
Lawson foresaw London becoming the world ' s pre - eminent financial centre , because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo .
DIXONS HAS 56 PCT OF CYCLOPS CORP Dixons Group Plc & lt ; DXNS . L > said its tender offer for all of the common shares in & lt ; Cyclops Corp > of the U . S .
Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted approximately 2 . 3 mln shares in the company at 90 . 25 dlrs each .
This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis .
But including shares already owned , Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares .
The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common stock of Cyclops , which total some 5 . 4 mln shares , at 90 . 25 dlrs each .
Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not withdrawn .
Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17 this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over the U . K . Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc & lt ; WLUK . L >.
Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p , up on last night ' s close of 380p .
On Friday , & lt ; CYACQ Corp >, an investor group formed by Audio / Video Affiliates Inc & lt ; AVA > and Citicorp & lt ; CCI >, said it would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares to 92 . 50 dlrs from 80 . 00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it with confidential information given to Dixons and if it were satisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or expenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded or proved invalid .
Audio / Video ' s offer is scheduled to expire March 20 .
IRAQ SAYS IT ATTACKS TWO SHIPS IN GULF Iraq said its warplanes hit two ships off the Iranian coast in attacks last night and early today .
The planes " dealt accurate and effective blows to both maritime targets before they returned safely to base ," a military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA .
There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Persian Gulf shipping sources .
The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8 , when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran ' s Kharg island oil export terminal .
Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile .
They said there were no injuries on board and the ship headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power after the fire was put out .
The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime extension of the 6 - 1 / 2 year - old Iran - Iraq war .

NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987 / 88 New Zealand ' s inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988 , the Institute of Economic Research ( NZIER ) said .
The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product ( GDP ) forecast to a fall of 0 . 5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December .
Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1 . 8 pct in the quarter to September and 3 . 4 pct in the June quarter .
The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value - added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986 / 87 .
The government ' s tight fiscal position is not expected to change , it said .
Annual inflation , measured by the consumer price index , is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18 . 2 pct in calendar 1986 , it said .
" Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates ; real interest rates are also expected to ease ( albeit slightly ) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital , falls away ," the NZIER said .
Short - term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter , but will decline over the second half of 1987 / 88 to between 16 and 18 pct .
Long - term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct .
Five year government bond rates are currently 18 . 40 pct and the key indicator 30 - day bank bills 26 . 53 pct .
The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and , by next March , reach 57 . 5 on the Reserve Bank ' s trade weighted index , which is based on a basket of currencies .
The index now stands at around 66 . 4 .
" A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast ," the NZIER said .
" The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7 . 5 pct of GDP in 1985 / 86 to 4 . 5 pct in 1986 / 87 and 2 . 5 pct in 1987 / 88 .
" The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1 . 32 billion N . Z .
Dlrs in 1987 / 88 from 2 . 40 billion in 1986 / 87 and 3 . 33 billion in 1985 / 86 .
The 1987 / 88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2 . 8 billion dlrs against an expected 2 . 9 billion dlrs in 1986 / 87 and 1 . 87 billion in 1985 / 86 .
This compares with the government ' s 1986 / 87 deficit figure of 2 . 92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2 . 45 billion .
" Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...," the NZIER said .
" Overall , these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and , if they continue to be improved upon , bode well for future prospects .
"
ICCO MEMBERS ACCEPT BUFFER STOCK PRINCIPLES International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation , delegates said .
The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn , who wrote up the draft compromise , to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates , they said .
The working group broke up for the day , into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details , delegates said .
Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out .
" Whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather ," one delegate said .
Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow , delegates said .
The principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system , a limit to the amount of non - ICCO member cocoa that can be bought , and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock , delegates said .
AFG & lt ; AFG >, WAGNER / BROWN BID FOR GENCORP & lt ; GY > & lt ; General Partners >, controlled by privately - held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc , said it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights for 100 dlrs a share .
GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at 90 . 50 dlrs a share , up two dlrs on the day .
In a newspaper advertisement , General Partners said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended .
General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at least 51 pct voting power , again fully diluted .
It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp shares .
General Partners said it would set up voting trust arrangements pending review of its long - form application for FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp ' s broadcasting subsidiary .
The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the company ' s articles of incorporation and code of regulations to provide for an increase in authorized common shares , a classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative voting .
The latter two changes would make it harder for minority shareholders to elect directors .
General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer .
GenCorp has about 22 . 3 mln shares outstanding , making the value of the offer about 2 . 23 billion dlrs .
Last fall , AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire & lt ; Lear Siegler Inc > for about 1 . 44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
Lear Siegler eventually went private for 1 . 66 billion dlrs .
GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace as well as broadcasting .
The company faces challenges to its two television and 12 radio station licenses , partly becuase it failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign payments and political contributions .
GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York - area television station WOR to MCA Inc & lt ; MCA > for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co & lt ; DIS > for 217 mln dlrs .
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney .
For the year ended November 30 , GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3 . 10 billion dlrs .
A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid .

The company will continue to post a Louisiana price , it said .

COASTAL & lt ; CGP > SAYS TRANSAMERICAN SUIT FRIVOLOUS Coastal Corp said it belives the two billion dlr suit against it by & lt ; TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp > in Texas state court is frivolous and without merit .
The company said it intends toi proceed with filing a reorganization plan for TransAmerican with the U . S . Bankruptcy Court in Houston .
Yesterday afternoon , the bankruptcy court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting TransAmerican and Coastal from taking any action in any court that would interfere with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court .
Yesterday ' s bankruptcy court ruling affirmed Coastal ' s rights as a TransAmerican creditor to file a reorganization plan for TransAmerican .
TransAmerican ' s suit alleges that Coastla attempted to unlawfully gain control of TransAmerican ' s Texas natural gas reserves and pipeline system .
TransAmerican ' s bankruptcy proceedings began in 1983 .
BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow ' s regular central bank council meeting , bank economists and dealers said .
" There is no need for action ," Hermann Remsperger , chief economist of Berliner Handels - and Frankfurter Bank ( BHF ) said .
Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month ' s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone , so a change in credit policies could be ruled out .
One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed .
Bank economists said U . S . Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact .
But such demands could re - emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U . S . Trade deficit .
Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates .
Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7 . 5 pct in February , unchanged from the 7 . 5 pct in January .
Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates .
But Poehl played down the risk of inflation .
Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success .
Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year .
" The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing ," one economist said .
He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds .
This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels , money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium - term .
These developments were increasing the Bundesbank ' s scope for a rate cut in the medium - term , economists said .
Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed , indicating no change in credit policy was expected .
Call money rates declined to 3 . 75 / 80 pct from 3 . 90 / 95 yesterday , with the market well stocked with liquidity .
Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far .
But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month ' s major tax payment period is felt .
Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market .
The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week , but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government - owned banks .
Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3 . 80 .
One dealer said , " If the central bank wanted lower interest rates , it would first of all drive call money rates down .
" Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets .
They held 52 . 9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday , averaging 53 . 7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March .
A requirement of around 51 billion is expected .
U . S . REAL GNP ROSE 1 . 1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER The U . S .
Gross National Product , after removing the impact of inflation , increased at a revised annual rate of 1 . 1 pct in the fourth quarter , the Commerce Department said .
That was down from an earlier preliminary 1 . 3 pct rise estimated a month ago and down from the 2 . 1 pct rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 .
The final fourth quarter revision , however , left unchanged the previous estimate of a 2 . 5 pct increase in GNP for all of 1986 over 1985 .
The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total decrease of 28 . 5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , the department said .
The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending decreased 2 . 2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an increase of 39 . 6 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
Exports of goods and services rose 15 . 3 billion dlrs after a decline of 9 . 4 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
Imports decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter , in contrast to an increase of 20 . 9 billion dlrs in the third quarter .
JAPAN TELECOM MERGER COULD INVOLVE U . K ., U . S .
FIRMS Cable and Wireless PLC & lt ; CAWL . L > and the Pacific Telesis group & lt ; PAC . N > may take part in a proposed merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan ' s international telecommunications market , a senior industry official said .
Fumio Watanabe , head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations ( Keidanren ), told a news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums agreed that the U . S . And British companies will be invited to participate in the new merged firm .
The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo ' s request that only one private company should enter the market .
The two consortiums , & lt ; International Digital Communications Planning Inc > ( IDC ) and & lt ; International Telecom Japan > ( ITJ ), were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly & lt ; Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co > ( KDD ) after the market was deregulated in 1985 .
Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake .
He estimated the two foreign firms ' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house & lt ; C . Itoh and Co .> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co . Inc . & lt ; MER . N > jointly hold 13 pct .
ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses .
Several firms including Toyota Motor Corp . & lt ; TOYO . T > belong to both .
Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the government on having only one private consortium as two companies might invest " excessive " amounts .
He said talks with Cable & amp ; Wireless will continue this week .
FERRUZZI NEGOTIATING EUROPEAN ACQUISITION Italy ' s & lt ; Gruppo Ferruzzi > is in the advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an acquisition worth " some hundreds of billions of lire " in the European agro - industrial sector , a company spokesman told Reuters .
The spokesman declined to identify the other party or parties involved in talks , or whether a complete takeover was under discussion , but said an Italian newspaper report that Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for 13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U . S . Group CPC International Inc & lt ; CPC . N > was incorrect .
The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by Ferruzzi but that the company ' s attention at the moment was " decisively in another direction .
" The spokesman , responding to a report in the Italian economic daily Il Sole - 24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a possible bid for the CPC plants , told Reuters his company hoped to conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months .
The spokesman said that since the U . K . Government last month blocked Ferruzzi ' s bid to acquire & lt ; British Sugar Plc >, the company had been looking at other investment opportunities .
MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER , TRADERS SAY Malaysia ' s state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) from May 1 , trade sources said .
Malaysia cut its 510 , 000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices , and the latest cut would reduce output by 17 . 5 pct from 1986 ' s target level .
Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid - 1987 .
However , the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia ' s crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510 , 000 bpd in 1987 .
The ministry ' s forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs / barrel ( bbl ), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks , the sources said .
Malaysia ' s benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs / bbl this year against a low of 10 . 50 dlrs / bbl in July , they said .
Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output .
The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices , as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives , the sources said .
In addition to term sales , Petronas has been offering two to three 400 , 000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender , the sources said .
However , this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production , they said .
INTERCARE & lt ; CARE > SAYS ACQUISITION TERMINATED InterCare Inc said it has agreed to terminate the proposed acquisition of & lt ; Universal Care > because & lt ; First Jersey Securities > has withdrawn as underwriter for a proposed offering of InterCare securities .
The company said the offering was to have raised 7 , 500 , 000 dlrs for working capital through the sale of equity and debt and would have also financed the 1 , 897 , 000 dlr cash portion of the Universal Care purchase price .
In addition , 1 , 700 , 000 dlrs would have been used to repay debt .
InterCare said to date it has incurred about 500 , 000 dlrs in expenses in connection with the proposed offering .
The company said to improve its working capital position , it plans to reduce operating expenses by decreasing hours of operation and its workforce and selling some assets .
As of October 31 , the copmpany said it had a working capital deficit of 2 , 301 , 000 dlrs , on a pro forma basis to include recently acquired U . S . Medical Enterprises Inc .
RANK ORGANISATION CURRENT TRADING SATISFACTORY Rank Organisation Plc & lt ; RANK . L > said trading in the current year had continued satisfactorily taking into account seasonal fluctuations .

It said it planned to spend some 15 mln stg on refurbishing its Odeon cinema chain and the Rank Film Distributors unit was committed to spending 20 mln to secure international distribution rights of films .
Investment in new activities in 1987 should continue at a relatively high level to exploit opportunities for growth .
Rank said it did not exclude the possibility of making large as well as small acquisitions .
In the year to end - October , Rank reported a rise in pretax profits to 164 . 1 mln stg from 136 . 0 mln previously .
Rank shares firmed in morning trading to be quoted at 712p at 1320 GMT after 697p at last night ' s close .

DAVY CORP UNIT WINS INDIA SMELTER CONTRACT Davy McKee Ltd , a subsidiary of U . K . Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc , has been awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a zinc and lead smelter in India , a spokesman for the company said .
The contract is being funded by Britain ' s Overseas Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73 . 65 mln stg to India ' s state - owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd .
The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan , North West India , the agency said .
The agency said the project was expected to account for 44 pct of India ' s total production of zinc .
A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply of goods and services from Britain .
The grant comes as part of package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development .
The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India ' s coal sector , for the expansion of its indigenous coal development programme , using British - designed longwall technology .

WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates , banking sources said .
The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates , far longer than the usual interim period .
A Deutsche Bank AG & lt ; DBKG . F > spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0 . 5 percentage points to two pct .
Dresdner Bank AG & lt ; DRSD . F > and Commerzbank AG & lt ; CBKG . F > have initiated similar moves .
Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG & lt ; BKFG . F > cut rates 0 . 5 pct generally .
The delay was partly due to commercial banks ' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks .
A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks , forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources , one economist at the German Banking Association said .
But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future , he said .
He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short - term deposits to longer - dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate .
The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7 . 5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year , unchanged from January .
The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct .
Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers , though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline .

GENCORP & lt ; GY > GROUP HOLDS 9 . 8 PCT STAKE ( General Partners ), a Texas general partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc & lt ; AFG >, said it currently holds 2 , 180 , 608 common shares , or about 9 . 8 pct , of Gencorp Inc ' s & lt ; GY > outstanding common stock .
General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash tender offer for all of Gencorp , an Akron , Ohio - based concern , that is worth nearly 2 . 3 billion dlrs .
Gencorp , which has interests in tire - and plastic - making , aerospace and broadcasting , has about 22 . 3 mln shares outstanding .
The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of financing , a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions .
In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A . William Reynolds describing the offer , General Partners said it was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to meet as soon as possible .
In a statement , General Partners said it has contributed 250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co & lt ; WFC > and a 1 . 25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , a unit of American Express Co & lt ; AXP >.
A Gencorp spokesman said the company ' s management was meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today .
He said he was not sure the company had formally received notice of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts .
He declined to say what Gencorp ' s next move might be or whether it would issue a statement later today .
In the letter , General Partners said it plans to maintain Gencorp ' s corporate headquarters in Akron , and retain the company ' s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment .
The letter did not mention Gencorp ' s RKO General broadcasting subsidiary , which has been involved in disputes over license renewals at several of its television stations .
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations , WOR in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles .
General Partners officials were not immediately available .
Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders , and the NYSE said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115 .
The shares closed up two yesterday at 90 - 1 / 2 , a new 52 - week high .
The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in equity from General Partners , the 1 . 25 billion dlr loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers , a senior subordinated bridge loan for which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours after a request from the partnership , and the one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo .
Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest , the partnership said .
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in the tender offer , it said .
In the letter , the partnership said it was confident it could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly .
Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered to acquired ( Lear Siegler Inc ) for about 1 . 44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged .
Lear Siegler eventually went private for about 1 . 66 billion dlrs .
THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FEBRUARY Thailand ' s trade deficit widened to an estimated 4 . 7 billion baht in February from 2 . 1 billion in January and 2 . 8 billion a year ago , the Bank of Thailand said .
Exports fell to around 18 . 9 billion baht from 20 . 4 billion in January compared with 17 . 4 billion a year ago , the bank said .

A surplus in the country ' s balance of payments narrowed to 3 . 2 billion baht in February from 4 . 6 billion the previous month but was higher than 1 . 5 billion a year ago .
The bank said the balance of payments surplus for the first two months of 1987 widened to 7 . 8 billion baht from 4 . 6 billion from the same period in 1986 , while the net capital inflow rose to five billion baht from 3 . 1 billion .

MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS & lt ; Morgan Grenfell Group Plc > said its 1986 pre - tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc & lt ; GUIN . L > shares and because of securities trading losses in the U . S . Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group ' s seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3 . 5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82 . 2 mln .
He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested .
No formal offers had been made , but Catto would not elaborate .
Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company ' s successful bid for Distillers Co Plc & lt ; DIST . L > in the first half of last year .
The U . K . Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December .
Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U . K . Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid .
Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves , head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair .
Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive , Geoffrey Collier , resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information .
He currently faces criminal charges .
Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been " one of the most traumatic in our history ," but that clients and staff had been supportive .
" I certainly look on the future in a positive way .
We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet .
" Profits for the year , up 19 . 4 pct from 1985 pre - tax profits of 68 . 8 mln stg , were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management .

SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT ' L & lt ; AG > The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement action against Allegheny International Inc , the Pittsburgh - based industrial and consumer products firm said .
Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc . " Following announcement of the merger agreement , the company was informed by the Enforcement Division of the ( SEC ) that it intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a proceeding against the company ," Allegheny said .
" The company is cooperating in the commission ' s investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking of testimony of employes and others ," Allegheny said .
In the ongoing probe , Allegheny said , the staff has asked for information about company executive compensation and benefit plans , certain company - owned real estate , travel and entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft .
It also has asked for information on acquisitions and divestitures , the company ' s accounting system " and other internal controls ," Allegheny said .
The probe began in February 1986 , Allegheny said .
The SEC , as a matter of policy , routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions .
The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements .
The suits , later consolidated into a single class - action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court , allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors .
Earlier this month , lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that , in the buyout , Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price .
Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges .
The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer ' s resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley .
In the buyout , a group led by First Boston tendered March 13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24 . 60 dlrs a share .

VW ' S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986 Audi AG & lt ; NSUG . F >, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG & lt ; VOWG . F >, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985 , when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit , a rise of 19 . 5 pct on the previous year .
Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986 , but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels .
He gave no figure for 1986 profit .
Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985 ' s record levels .
Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9 . 9 billion marks from 9 . 6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year .
Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses , Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits .
Audi ' s entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment .
In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi ' s earnings as a dividend .
Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model , on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U . S . About alleged " sudden acceleration " of some of its Audi 5000 models .
As reported , Audi ' s sales in the U . S .
Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59 , 800 last year .
Habbel said the U . S .
Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987 .
Audi ' s worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363 , 000 .
Of the total , exports fell 10 . 5 pct to a rounded 210 , 000 , but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154 , 000 from 137 , 180 in 1985 .
Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987 , helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8 . 4 pct from 5 . 2 pct in the same months of 1986 .
Sales in Europe also rose but U . S .
Sales fell further , he said without giving details .
Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57 , 000 .
Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400 , 000 from 384 , 000 in 1986 , when output had fallen compared with 1985 ' s 392 , 000 .
Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees .
At the end of 1986 Audi ' s workforce stood at a record 39 , 800 , a rise of 3 , 400 over 1985 .
BANK OF ENGLAND LENDS ONE BILLION STG AT 10 PCT The Bank of England said it had lent one billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct .
This brings the Banks total help today to some 1 . 34 billion stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today which it had earlier estimated at 1 . 3 billion stg .
The Bank ' s announcement this morning that it was willing to lend two - week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as a sanction for lower U . K . Base lending rates .
The U . K . Clearing banks swiftly took this up , cutting their base rates by a half - point to 10 pct .
At midday , the central bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount .

CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL Most of the cattle now being placed on U . S . feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer , spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply .
The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements reported in the USDA ' s latest cattle on feed report , livestock analysts said .
After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in seven states as of March 1 , cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply .
The trade had expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a 15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago .
Although the heavy placements were expected , analysts noted reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter cattle into the autumn , rather than market them during the summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally placed on feed .
Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain , industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas .
The increase in lighter - weight cattle entering feedlots , helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from February , 1986 .
University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes said , " The probabilities are high that in order to place that many cattle on feed they ( feedlot operators ) had to go to lighter - weight cattle .
The only statistics available are from some terminal markets which represent only a small percentage of the total cattle marketed .
But at those markets , steers averaged 708 lbs in February compared with 718 lbs last year , Grimes said .
Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed , Grimes said , beef supply likely will be reduced .
If the average weight is down , and there is no price weakness to delay marketings , the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights , which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct .
Bruce Ginn , cattle analyst for The Helming Group ( formerly LBAS ), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly because of two factors : low grain prices and higher live cattle prices .
Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large , he noted .
Also , the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots , Ginn said .
Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions .
Gary Chapmann , a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and Graham in Sioux City , Iowa said he believed the general trend is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his area benefited from a dry , mild winter .
To the south , however , he said the weather was wetter and some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter .
N . Y . COCOA TRADERS STILL CAUTIOUS ON ICCO New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to today ' s developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London , saying there is still time for negotiations to break down .
" I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point ," said Jack Ward , president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat .
" If and when a final position comes out ( of the ICCO talks ) one will still have time to put on positions .
The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain .
" ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation .
A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details .
" Market sentiment has reflected optimism , I would ' t put it any stronger than that ," Ward said .
" It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement ... but one shouldn ' t forget how much they have to negotiate ," said another trader of today ' s developments .
Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so , traders said .
" The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms ," one trader said .
Speculators have gone net long " but only slightly so ," he added .
The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling ' s rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling , traders said .
REAGAN UPBEAT ABOUT LATEST GNP FIGURES President Reagan said the 1 . 1 pct U . S . economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986 " wasn ' t all that bad .
" The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the Gross National Product in the October - December period was only slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1 . 3 pct made earlier .
At the same time , it said inflation , as measured by the GNP price deflator , rose by 0 . 7 pct during the period .
Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House photo session , Reagan replied , " It wasn ' t all that bad .

PHILIP CROSBY & lt ; PCRO > SEES LOWER 4TH QTR RESULTS Philip Crosby Associates Inc said it expects its audited results for 1986 ' s fourth quarter to be lower than its previously estimated 10 to 15 cts per share .

STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER Silver looks " unlikely to break out of gold and platinum ' s shadow " in the near future , although this year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than supply , a study by Credit Suisse said .
The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13 , 200 tonnes this year , against a 50 tonne increase in supply to 14 , 050 tonnes .
This should cut the global oversupply to 850 tonnes from last year ' s provisional 1 , 100 tonnes .
The study noted that the effects of last year ' s lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply , which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago .
However , the study said that primary production , likely to reach 10 , 000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9 , 950 in 1986 , is relatively insensitive to price falls .
Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru .
Price - sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by - product of other mining activity .

U . K . BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON , SAY ANALYSTS Today ' s modest half - point cut in U . K . Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England ' s determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance , but financial markets appear set to force its hand , analysts said .
They said a further half - point cut in base rates to 9 - 1 / 2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant .
Earlier , markets were bracing for a one - point cut in rates after yesterday ' s budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg .
Sterling money market rates moved lower again , with the key three - month interbank rate down to 9 - 5 / 8 1 / 2 pct at the start of business from 9 - 11 / 16 9 / 16 yesterday , and sterling rallied to four - year highs against the dollar in very active trading .
Government bond prices also surged on the budget , with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long - term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year .
But today ' s smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now , analysts said .
Money market rates recovered up to 1 / 4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt .
Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary , and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow , leading to higher gilt prices , exchange rate advances and lower money market rates .
" Today ' s cut was slightly disappointing ," said Bill Martin , chief U . K .
Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew .
" The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets ' first rush of blood to the head after the budget .
" Analysts said the bank ' s move today to lend two - week cash to U . K . Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time .
The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term .
Sharp rises in the pound ' s value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again .
" The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being ," said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds .
" But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long .
" Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U . S .
Cents this week from around 1 . 60 dlrs , forcing a rate cut by Friday .
Robin Marshall , chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities , said " There is another half point to come in the near term , this week or next week at the latest ... We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks .
" Analysts stressed that apart from prestige , Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling ' s exchange rate .
Martin , of Phillips and Drew , said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately .
Analysts said the budget , featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances , had improved the chances of re - election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date .
One must be held before June , 1988 .
Combined with overall good prospects for the U . K . Economy , this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling - denominated assets , pushing the pound ' s value well above unofficial targets .
With mark - denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook , Chase ' s Marshall said " Sterling is simply the best game in town , especially after the budget , and demand will remain strong .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY Japan ' s ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers , industry sources told Reuters .
The salvage measures , which include a government - sponsored rationalisation program , are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan , the world leader , has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages , they said .
The sources said South Korea ' s yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan ' s due to such factors .
The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June , the sources said .
They said from September a semi - government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity , and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment .
Last Friday , the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1 .
The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month , the sources said .
A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost - cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness , they said .
Under the cartel proposals , 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10 , 000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes ( CGRT ) in 1987 / 88 .
This is about half of total capacity .
This will ease the cut - throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost , the sources said .
The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988 / 89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3 . 1 mln CGRT in 1988 / 89 from 3 . 3 mln in 1987 / 88 , they said .
The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 of the estimated 100 , 000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 .
Japanese yards topped world order books at end - December , followed by South Korea and Taiwan , according to Lloyd ' s Register of Shipping .
However , falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry , the sources said .
Four of Japan ' s six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986 / 7 , they said .
The shipbuilding companies ' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years , the sources said .
In Japan , no single yard leads the industry , resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity .
The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd & lt ; MITH . T > and Ishikawajima - Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd & lt ; JIMA . T > -- account for only 30 pct of ships built , the sources said .
" World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world ," said an official at a major Japanese shipping company .
The Japanese merchant fleet , the largest after Liberia ' s , has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships , and this will encourage Japanese yards , the sources said .

FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES IN MONEY MARKET The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U . S . Government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1 . 5 billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements , economists said .
They said the below - six pct Federal funds rate suggests the Fed does not have a large reserve adding need .
However , some dealers reportedly backed out of the three - day System repurchase agreements set on Monday , leaving the Fed with a somewhat increased need to supply reserves .
Federal funds , which averaged 6 . 05 pct yesterday , opened at 5 - 15 / 16 pct and remained there in early trading .
SURALCO BAUXITE REFINERY REOPENED The 1 . 4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite refinery at Paranam in Surinam , which closed at the end of January after being sabotaged by anti - government rebels , has now reopened , a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton said .
The refinery is run by Suralco , jointly owned by the U . S . Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton , which is a wholly - owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell .
Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running at around 3 , 000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to full capacity of 4 , 000 tonnes within a week , the Billiton spokesman added .
The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when rebels cut the main power line .
Earlier , the refinery had had to import some supplies of bauxite , as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa ' s mine at Moengo in the east of the country .
Billiton ' s mine at Onverdacht , between Paranam and the capital Paramaribo , is still working but Moengo remains closed and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite , the Billiton spokesman said .
CONT ' L ILLINOIS & lt ; CIL > SAYS MORATORIUM MAY CUT NET Continental Illinois Corp said if the Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect , it may place its medium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis .
This would increase non - performing loans by about 380 mln dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10 mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year , company officials told a press briefing .
Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs , according to the annual report released at the briefing .
In February 1987 , the Brazilian government , citing a declining level of foreign currency reserves , declared a moratorium on the payment of interest on the country ' s medium and long term debt obligations .
Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to Ecuador , which total 25 mln dlrs .
This would reduce 1987 pre - tax and after - tax net by 800 , 000 dlrs in the first quarter , and by two mln dlrs for the full year , the bank - holding company ' s officers said .

HANDY AND HARMAN SEES SUFFICIENT SILVER SUPPLIES World stocks of silver are large enough to accommodate any changes in the supply - demand equation this year , with industrial consumption expected to again exceed mine production , the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its annual review of the silver market .
The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew 20 , 000 , 000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403 , 000 , 000 ounces and production level of 382 , 000 , 000 ounces .
However , world stocks are huge , totaling 2 , 267 , 900 , 000 ounces at the end of 1986 , it said .
The review noted that world industrial consumption has been on an uptrend since 1980 , although offtake is still 14 pct below the 1978 level of 442 , 000 , 000 ounces .
Handy and Harman said 22 , 800 , 000 ounces of silver were used to produce coins last year , up from 12 , 700 , 000 ounces in 1985 , with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U . S . coins , including the American Eagle .
It also said that in recent years Communist countries have increased their silver imports and estimated that China and East Germany alone took in 70 , 000 , 000 ounces of foreign silver in the last five years .

GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Finance and economy ministers of the six - nation Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration .
But the ministers from Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system .
The UAE ' s Minister of State for Finance and Industry , Ahmed Humaid al - Tayer , told reporters after the two - day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion .
He said the governors , who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based , were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July , when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia .
Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue , adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year .
The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public , but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System ( EMS ).
Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state .
They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms .
He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year ' s Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union , and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin .

DOE SECRETARY FAVORS HIGHER SPR FILL RATE Energy Secretary John Herrington said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning of growing U . S . dependence on oil imports .
" As part of this study , I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review ," Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing .
The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75 , 000 barrels of oil per day to 35 , 000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money .
" My personal feeling is that is too low .
I favor the maximum fill rate ( of 100 , 000 bpd )," Herrington said .
CONT ' L ILLINOIS & lt ; CIL > SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp , the company ' s annual report says .
One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past , be restored to current earnings status , it said .
As a result , those amounts will be subject to federal taxes , it said .
No amounts were disclosed .
Continental said it decided to deal with this change " in its entirety " in 1987 .
Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules , and although the impact will not be material in the short term , the Act will require , for the first time , that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable , the report said .
The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17 . 5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years , it said .
Continental ' s investment tax credits carryforwards of 12 . 8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10 . 6 mln dlrs in 1987 and , if not used in 1987 , to 8 . 3 mln dlrs in 1988 , it said .
Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place , the report said .
This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental ' s common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership , it noted .
In December , the FDIC sold about one - third of its junior convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in the form of common stock .

U . S . CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U . S . corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels , cash grain dealers said .
Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport , Iowa , said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain .
By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn , the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales , where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed .
If the USDA acts soon , as many dealers expect , the movement would break the Gulf corn basis .
" The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices ," one dealer said .
" It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City ," which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest .
" But we don ' t know when they might do it ," an Ohio dealer said , which has created uncertainty in the market .
The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage .
Yesterday , USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3 . 85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers ( in lieu of cash payments ) had to date been exchanged for grain .
With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months , the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices , cash grain dealers said .
A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals , cash dealers said .
Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price .
The mild winter and early reopening of the mid - Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight , dealers noted .
The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels , squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings , they said .
" The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports ," which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4 . 0 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , one Midwest cash grain trader said .
But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside , freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system .

GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1 . 5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year .
The institute , whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes , said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986 , and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn .
The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product ( GNP ) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real , seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year .
The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters , it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1 . 5 pct .
Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct .
In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development , with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak .
DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods , and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods , not between foreign and domestic demand .
It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports , which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans .
Service industries , unlike manufacturing industry , were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand , it said .
In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany ' s real trade surplus would fall markedly this year .
However , the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986 ' s record 112 . 2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986 , it said .

U . S . OIL TAX BREAK PROPOSAL TO BE EXAMINED The White House said a proposal for a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review .
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry .
But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks .
He said that even though Herrington ' s recommendation did not agree with existing policy , " We ' ll take a look at it .
" The review will be undertaken by the president ' s Domestic Policy Council .
Herrington ' s proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s , threatening U . S . national security .

FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long - term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation .
The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7 . 5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25 .
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program .
Long - term unemployment , defined as being out of work for more than one year , affects about 830 , 000 people or one third of French unemployed , government figures show .
The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short - term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long - term unemployed return to the labour market .
Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers .
" Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that ' s why the proposals ... Are costly ," an aide to Seguin said .
The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin , who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy .
He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government ' s revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2 . 0 pct from 2 . 8 .
Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin ' s remarks , saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France ' s five - year privatisation plan .
The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation , to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital .
Some political analysts said Baudouin ' s comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR - UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year ' s presidential elections .
Divisions began to show last December , when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour .
Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain & lt ; SGEP . PA > and Cie Financiere de Paribas & lt ; PARI . PA > the government had decided to speed up its five - year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year , ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988 .
The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network .
The government also today revived a proposal , blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand , to encourage more flexible working hours , which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry .
The proposals allowing night - shift work by women and variations in the standard 39 - hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self - contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State .
AIR CANADA TO ACQUIRE CALGARY COURIER COMPANY Air Canada , the state - owned airline , said it signed a letter of intent to acquire 65 pct of EMS Corp , a Calgary - based messenger service which operates in Western Canada and the U . S .. Gelco Corp ( GEL ) earlier said Air Canada agreed to buy its Canadian Gelco Express Ltd unit for 54 mln U . S . dlrs .
Air Canada said the acquisitions will complement its main cargo business .
It said it expects the courier market to grow by about 25 to 30 pct a year .
U . S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration .
" These options boost production , while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee ," Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing .
" It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review .
" He said proposals , including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax , should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers .
" The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production .
I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year .
" The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports .
" We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995 ," Herrington said .
He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes .
" Of course , to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year ( in the tax reform bill ) -- an approach which has not , in general , been favored by the administration .
I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration ," he said .
He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices .
Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today ' s Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance .
Asked about the report by subcommittee members , Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost .

GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1 . 5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year .
The institute , whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes , said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986 , and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn .
The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product ( GNP ) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real , seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year .
MORRISON KNUDSEN & lt ; MRN > SEES YEAR NET FALLING Morrison Knudsen Corp said its earnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986 due to lower than expected growth in engineering and construction and a previously - predicted decline in earnings of its National Steel and Shipbuilding unit .
The company earned 39 . 4 mln dlrs in 1986 , including pretax gains of 11 . 5 mln dlrs from pension income and 7 , 400 , 000 dlrs from the settlement of vested pension obligations , down from 41 . 5 mln dlrs in 1985 .
It said " Lower than expected levels of new work booked in the last quarter of 1986 and the first two - plus months of this year have delayed the expected growth in the engineering and construction area .
" The company said it will remain profitable in 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses .
It attributed the decline in new work to more stringent bidding standards and a competitive market .

The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall trade bill which is being written by several House committees .
The subcommittee ' s bill would bar imports of digital audio recording equipment that is not made with anti - copying chips .
This provision is designed to protect U . S . companies from the unauthorized use of U . S . designs in foreign products .
The bill calls for an investigation of whether U . S . engineering and construction firms are given adequate opportunity to bid on Japan ' s civil works procurement practices including the construction of the Kansai airport .
The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered by Rep . William Dannemeyer , a California Republican , to require the U . S . to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold investments in government storage .
His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins and gold - backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal debt .

ENERGY / DRILLING INDUSTRY The drastic cutbacks in U . S . drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State ' s natural gas bubble , which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch , industry analysts said .
Faltering deliverability of natural gas , a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities , could more than double the current U . S . rig count to near 2 , 000 by 1990 , some analysts said .
The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico ' s offshore waters where some of the nation ' s largest gas reserves are located .
" We think an upturn in U . S . drilling is imminent ," said James Crandall , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc . " Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they ' re betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two .
" The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year ' s plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that .
Today ' s relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U . S . drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4 , 500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages .
The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co & lt ; HT > rig count , a barometer of the oil industry ' s health , showed 761 U . S . rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year .
In 1986 , the Hughes rig count began the year at 1 , 915 but dived to a post - World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times .
Ike Kerridge , a Hughes economist , said " In 1986 , the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won ' t be any better this year .
" He added , " We don ' t have the options we do with oil .
Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost .
" Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U . S . consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet , according to industry estimates .
George Gaspar , an oil analyst with Robert W . Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U . S . drilling .
" We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies .
That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid - 1988 ," Gaspar said .
Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2 , 000 in December of 1989 .
Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico , where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years .
Some of the industry ' s biggest companies , such as Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, Mobil Corp MOB , and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico , Crandall said .
For example , Conoco Inc , a Dupont & lt ; DD > subsidiary , will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico ' s deepest production platform , which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day .
But T . Boone Pickens , who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership & lt ; MLP > in recent months , is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery .
Pickens predicts the U . S . rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do .
" The rigs won ' t go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel ," said Pickens , 58 , adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2 , 000 again in his lifetime .
Tenneco Inc & lt ; TGT >, one of the largest U . S . gas producers , is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists .
Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U . S . gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years ' supply .
Current spot market prices of about 1 . 50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement , he said .
SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production , official and trade sources said .
Although prices have risen to around eight from five U . S .
Cents per lb in the past six months , they are still below the region ' s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost .
The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert , Manuel Rico , a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries ( GEPLACEA ), told Reuters .
However , Rico said , it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output .
" Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable ," he said .
Officials in Mexico , Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production , but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go .
" The prices are ridiculous ," said Julian Mateo , vice president of Costa Rica ' s Sugar Cane Industrial - Agricultural League .
" At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production .
" Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output , given the instability of world markets .
An official at Colombia ' s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets .
" The market is very unstable .
What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything .
" In 1985 , the latest year for which full figures are available , Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes , raw value , of sugar of which 12 . 3 mln were exported .
A year earlier , they had produced and exported about 800 , 000 more , according to the London - based International Sugar Organization .
Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover .
Miguel Guerrero , director of the Dominican Republic ' s National Sugar Institute , said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply .
Output had slumped to under 450 , 000 tonnes a year from 900 , 000 in the late 1970s .
Obsolete refineries , poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output , he added .
Plans of nearby Cuba , the world ' s largest cane sugar exporter , to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious , trade sources said .
Output is running well below the record 8 . 6 mln produced in 1970 .
Cuba suffers from run down plantations , harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices , since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals .
Last year , bad weather added to its troubles , and output fell to 7 . 2 mln tonnes from 8 . 2 mln in 1985 .
The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U . S . And , in the case of some Caribbean countries , European Community ( EC ) import quotas , for which they receive prices well above free market levels .
Progressive reductions in the U . S . Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market .
Peru , for example , shipped 96 , 000 tonnes to the U . S .
In both 1983 and 1984 .
This fell to 76 , 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 , 000 .
A national cooperative official said that , as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru ' s production cost , the future of the industry is uncertain .
At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which , according to the group ' s executive - secretary Eduardo Latorre , " grows like a weed " throughout the region .
Brazil , the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes , uses over half to produce alcohol fuel .
Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency .
The difference in the price the state - run Sugar and Alcohol Institute ( IAA ) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year .
Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year , coupled with a drought - reduced cane crop , has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 , trade sources said .
Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far , the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non - delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace .
Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year , with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles .
However , the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps .
Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region ' s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U . S . And EC change their policies .
" The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets , by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries ," Brazil ' s Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting .
The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets .
GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices .
GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region ' s industry out of steady decline .
Such an agreement would have to have both U . S . And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact .
" They have to realise that the more our economies suffer , the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region ' s 360 billion dollar foreign debt ," GEPLACEA ' s Latorre said .
MORGAN BANK PLANS WARRANTS FOR GOLD AT 425 DLRS Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York plans an issue of 12 , 000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs an ounce , lead manager Morgan Guaranty ( Switzerland ) AG said .
Each warrant , priced at 955 Swiss francs , entitled holders to acquire five - ounce bars of . 999 gold in the period from April 30 , 1987 , to July 31 , 1991 , exercisable on Wednesdays .
The warrants represented unsecured , unsubordinated liabilities of the borrower .
Payment was due April 16 , and a quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned .
The warrants , when exercised , would be repaid in current dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date .
The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an ounce to the current gold price .
A Morgan ( Switzerland ) official said that on the basis of the maturity of four years and three months , the pricing involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24 . 5 pct before the warrants were in the money , compared with implicit volatility of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and 24 months .
NORSTAR & lt ; NOR >, FLEET & lt ; FLT > TO MERGE Norstar Bancorp said that its board and the board of Fleet Financial Group have approved a definitive agreement to merge .

AMOCO & lt ; AN > IN NATURAL GAS FIND OFF TRINIDAD Amoco Corp said its WEQB - 1 exploratory well 39 miles east of Galeota Point on Trinidad ' s east coast flowed 24 mln cubic feet of natural gas and 500 barrels of condensate daily from one zone and 29 mln cubic feet of natural gas and 600 barrels of condensate daily from a second .
The company said both flows were through 40 / 64 inch chokes and from zones between 10 , 000 and 13 , 000 feet in depth .
The well , in 260 feet of water , was drilled to a total depth of 14 , 629 feet , it said .
It said the discovery was made in sands previously untested in the area .

TALKING POINT / GENCORP INC & lt ; GY > The surprise 2 . 2 billion - dlr tender offer for Ohio - based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company , analysts said .
Analysts estimated the 100 dlr - per - share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp .
However , market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses .
Gencorp ' s stock rose 15 - 3 / 4 to 106 - 1 / 4 in heavy trading .
" The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management ' s cooperation ," said Larry Baker , an analyst with E . F . Hutton group .
Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp ' s broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations .
Some of the disputes , dating back about 20 years , were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions .
" I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation ," said Baker of the offer .
Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction .
A source close to General Partners , however , said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations .
The source said if approved , the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out .
If it received the " short - form " approval , General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved .
General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass - maker AFG Industries Inc .
Some market sources speculated an outside buyer , such as General Partners , might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp ' s plan to sell the stations .
GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station , WHJ - TV .
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station ' s license .
GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR - TV in Secaucus , N . J . to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs .
General Partners said it intends to keep the company ' s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment .
Charles Rose , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co , said that , on a breakup valuation , the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share .
Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs , as would DiversiTech , the plastics unit .
Broadcasting , including assets pending sale , might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share , he said .
The company , formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co , also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share .
He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share , he said .
Analysts said GenCorp chairman A . William Reynolds , who became chairman last year , has been emphasizing the company ' s Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses .
GenCorp , founded in 1915 , became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve .
" The management ' s doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non - strategic assets of the company ," Rose said .
Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer , but they declined to predict what steps the company might take .
They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer .
General Partners holds 9 . 8 pct of GenCorp stock , and there was some concern about " greenmail .
" Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders ' stock .
" I would doubt they would greenmail them , but nothing surprises me anymore ," said Rose .
GenCorp has not commented on the offer .
It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder , Peabody and Co as advisers .

NORSTAR & lt ; NOR >, FLEET & lt ; FLT > OUTLINE MERGER Fleet Financial Group said that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company .
Under terms of the transaction , each Norstar shareholder will receive 1 . 2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split .
The two - for - one stock split will increase Fleet ' s currently 25 . 7 mln outstanding shares to 51 . 5 shares .
There are about 34 . 9 mln Norstar shares outstanding .
Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988 , the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island ' s interstate banking law takes effect .
For the full year ended december 31 , Fleet , a Rhode Island based bank holding company , reported net income of 136 . 7 mln dlrs and assets of 11 . 7 billion dlrs .
Norstar , an Albany N . y . holding company , reported net income of 104 . 8 mln dlrs and assets of 11 . 1 billion dlrs .
Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet / Norstar earnings per share .
It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company ' s stock holders , the company said .
For 1986 , Norstar issued 1 . 31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock .
Fleet ' s current annual distibution on a pre - split basis would be equivalent to 1 . 68 dlrs a share .
In addition , Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock , that will constitute 24 . 99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding .
The transaction is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval .

CONT ' L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS Continental Illinois Corp ' s & lt ; CIL > Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil ' s debt payments taking at least three to six months .
Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium - and long - term debts .
The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way .
" I believe it will take three to six months , maybe longer , for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil ' s debt ," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing .
" I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run .
Just how long the run is is anybody ' s guess ," Swearingen said .
Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil ' s moritorium may force it to increase non - performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year .
The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non - performing , William Ogden , chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago , Continental ' s largest subsidiary , said in response to an inquiry .
Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use .
Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses .
Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs .
In 1986 it cut about 850 positions .
In 1986 it had net profits of 165 . 2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share , up from 150 . 5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share .
The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor - quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , FDIC , during 1986 .
It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government .
The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26 , 1987 , Swearingen said .
It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non - performing loans .
In 1986 the bank ' s loans to the Midwest ' s middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U . S .
Concerning banking acquisitions , Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks .
In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks .
Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it , and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks .
He said , however , that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln .
The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible .
The agency received the shares as part of its 4 . 5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank .
Swearingen , who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive , said he will retire when the three - year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August .
He would not comment on a successor .
The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo , Swearingen said , but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn ' t need external sources of cash .

EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL The European Community ( EC ) has warned the U . S . House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U . S . trading partners .
The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman , head of the EC delegation in Washington , to Dan Rostenkowski , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters .
Denman told Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat , he backed aspects of the bill , such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry .
But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U . S . and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices .
Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT - approved .
He said " If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory , then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners .
" Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws , saying " in the last resort , any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest .
" Otherwise , he said , " the risk would be counter - reaction by trading partners of the United States , i . e ., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States .
" Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims .
Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U . S . firms .
" Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally .
They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system ," he said .
House leaders have rejected a plan by textile - state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing , similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan .
There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment .
FAIRCHILD PRESIDENT SEEKING MANAGEMENT BUYOUT Fairchild Semiconductor Corp president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management buyout proposal to the company ' s parent at some point in the future and substantial funding is available for such a purchase .
Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd & lt ; SLB >.
Brooks also told a press conference that if management is successful , it may later attempt to take the company public .
" I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur , and I am hopeful that it does , the public market is one of the avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital ," Brooks said .
Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid .
Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild , a semiconductor maker , after U . S . government officials expressed opposition to the transaction .
Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout .
He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors .
Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them , but he added , " the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets .
" Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U . S . in an attempt to block the merger .
" I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington and Fujitsu , but that doesn ' t mean it doesn ' t exist ," Brooks said .
He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a link with Fairchild .
HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs , the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said .
Implementation of a 0 / 92 program , a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates , and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending , said Dan Glickman , D - Kans ., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains .
Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association , Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved .
Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget , Glickman added .
Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA ' s proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year .
" The administration ' s target price proposals are dead in the water ," he said .
To cut the budget , Glickman said , " everthing is on the table ," except those moves that would reduce farmers ' income .
Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending .
Implementation of a 0 / 92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman , which he said would result in a 150 - 200 mln dlr savings for one year .
Tightening up on the use of generic ( in - kind , or " pik ') certificates will also be another option his committee will study , Glickman said .
While not committing himself for or against such action , he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments .
Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100 - 200 mln dlrs .
He also said increasing acreage set - aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign - up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs , but added that he would not be in favor of such a change .
Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program ' s , EEP , spending authority of 1 . 5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up , and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas .
Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely , he said .
" I don ' t see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block ," Glickman said .
CPC & lt ; CPC > SEES 1987 HIGHER EARNINGS PER SHARE CPC International Inc said it expects 1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels .
" We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per share and are optimistic about our longer - term future as well ," the company said in its 1986 annual report .
In 1986 , CPC earned 219 . 2 mln dlrs , or 2 . 30 dlrs a share , on revenues of 4 . 55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142 mln dlrs or 1 . 46 dlrs on sales of 4 . 21 billion dlrs in 1985 .
The share figures are adjusted for a 2 - for - 1 split paid in January .
A share buyback program started last year reduced the number of shares outstanding to 82 . 6 mln at year - end 1986 from 97 . 2 mln dlrs the end of 1985 , adjusted for the split .
The food and grocery products company also said it was the subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit , filed last November and December in Delaware , New York and New Jersey .
The suits are related to the company ' s purchase of its shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block of the stock from Ronald Perelman , who had acquired nearly 3 . 7 mln CPC shares , or 7 . 6 pct of the company , last year .
The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an artificially inflated price , violating securities laws , breaching directors ' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets .
CPC said the defendants , which include the company , its directors , Salomon and Perelman , deny all the allegations of improper conduct and are defending the suits .
U . S . ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH The U . S . oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago , according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today .
The Commission , which regulates the state ' s oil and gas industry , heard testimony from a number of high - level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out .
" The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic ( than last year )," Commissioner James E . ( Jim ) Nugent told Reuters .
" It reflects their ( the executives ) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle ," he added , " and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again .
" The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices , which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid - 1986 .
Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel .
At the same time , a number of company executives testified that the nation ' s domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help .
Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations .
Currently , there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2 , 000 in 1985 .
Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy , many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U . S . demand , was leading to a growing dependency on imports , particularly from the politically volatile Middle East .
" In the U . S ., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices , increasing about 2 . 5 pct , or 400 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd )," said J . S .
Simon , General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, the nation ' s largest oil company .
At the same time , Simon said " U . S . oil production declined by 300 , 000 bpd , the first decline in several years ," and " net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5 . 3 mln bpd .
" Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel , depending on OPEC ' s ability to control production , Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels , leading to " a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity , in excess of 10 mln bpd .
" He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for " governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry .
" Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and " Superfund " legislation , Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax , total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration .
Simon did not mention an oil import fee , which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation ' s domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised .
In yesterday ' s report , the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U . S . demand by 1995 , adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world ' s total oil consumption by that date .
Arguing that " oil is a political tool in every nation on earth ," Frank Pitts , chairman of & lt ; Pitts Oil Co >, today called for a variable oil import fee , among other measures , " before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised .
" Royce Wisenbaker , Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co , agreed , saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions , it would probably turn into a " shambles .
" Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future .
" For those of us who have managed to hold on , the worst is over ," he said .
Roger Hemminghaus , President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co , said he was " enthusiastic about the future ," adding that he expected " an increase in profitability by midyear .
"

CAROLINA POWER & lt ; CPL > CANCELS GENERATING UNIT Carolina Power and Light Co said its board has decided to cancel coal - fired Mayo Unit Two , the second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County , N . C .
The company said the 690 , 000 kilowatt unit was only about one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in 1992 .
Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under review because of a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission that would have required the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide - removing scrubbers .
Carolina Power said Unit One , which has been in operation since 1983 , meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers through the use of low - sulphur coal , and " The addition of scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal air quality improvements .
" The company said it will be able to purchase lower - cost power from Duke Power Co & lt ; DUK > for intermediate and peaking purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with scrubbers .
It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later development of a generating unit .
Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about 877 mln dlrs , including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers .
" The higher construction costs , plus higher operating costs , would increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year .
" A company spokesman said the company has already spent about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two .
He said no estimate has yet been made of the cost of canceling the plant , but the company does not expect to take a charge against earnings .
He said Carolina Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings it will make late this year or early next year .

NE ELECTRIC & lt ; NES > AUDITORS QUALIFY ANNUAL REPORT New England Electric System ' s auditors have again qualified the utility ' s annual report because of uncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary can recover its investments .
The qualification was noted in the annual report which New England Electric released at a security analysts meeting today .
The auditors also qualified the company ' s 1985 report for the same reason , noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in early 1986 .
President Samuel Huntington told analysts the utility will have to take a write - down of about 235 mln dlrs if Federal regulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses cited by the accountants to its rate payers .

NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS New England Electric System & lt ; NES > expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year , up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986 , the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting .
It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989 .
The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro - Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro .
New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project .
The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year , 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England , the utility said .
New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987 .
The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year , adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total .
New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock .
Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well .
The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future , but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans .
President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years .
However , the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth , he said , pointing out that demand was up 5 . 2 pct in 1986 and 4 . 7 pct per year in the past four years .
He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy .
Huntington said New England Elecetric has " all but rejected new coal fired plants " to supply additional power .
He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules .
Later , vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas - fired , combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs , but has not rejected coal - fired fluidized bed units .
He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units , adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal - fired plant which burns pulverized coal .

WHEAT GROWERS SET STATE DEPT TRADE MEETING The National Association of Wheat Growers , NAWG , board of directors is scheduled to meet Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State Allen Wallis to discuss the Department ' s current role in farm trade policy , the association said .
NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the importance that exports hold for U . S . agriculture and the degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State Department trade policies to remain profitable .
" Foreign policy decisions of the U . S . State Department have in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product to overseas markets ," he said .
Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next month with representatives of the Soviet Union , and the NAWG " wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union .
" The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held in Washington to allow grower - leaders from around the country to meet with their state congressional delegations and members of the executive branch .
The purpose is to discuss the current situation for producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and regulatory agenda for the coming year , the NAWG statement said .
DOE SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration .

" It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review .
" " The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production .
I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day ," he said .
The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports .
" We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995 ," Herrington said .

LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION & lt ; LDMFA > SEES BETTER YEAR Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase by " substantially more " than the 30 pct average annual growth experienced in the last four years .
Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1 . 2 billion dlrs , including GSX Corp , the U . S . waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs , Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts .
Last year , Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66 . 2 mln dlrs , or 63 cts per share , on revenues of 717 . 8 mln dlrs .
De Groote also said the company expects " excellent results " in the second quarter ended February 28 , but would not be more specific .
He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990 .
De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct .
The rest came from acquisitions , he said .
Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation , a subsidiary of GSX , within the next few weeks , but this will not make any material contribution to earnings , de Groote said .
He also said he is " not very optimistic " about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd , a Toronto - based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U . S . operations , from & lt ; Trimac Ltd > of Calgary .
De Groote said that , regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition , Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp . " We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management ," de Groote said .
Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U . S . subsidiary , Laidlaw Transportation Inc , with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing .
De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants .
De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues , school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct .
The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it , he said .
He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year .
He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U . S . are likely within the next few months .

VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER Versatile Corp ' s shipbuilding subsidiary has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the Canadian coast guard , Transport Minister John Crosbie said .
In a Vancouver address , Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker , but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded .
The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel .
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile " will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work .
" Crosibie said Versatile ' s bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1 , 000 person years of direct employment .
Work on the vessel , which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world , would begin next year and completed in 1992 .
The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U . S . Coast Guard ' s vessel , the Polar Sea , through the disputed Northwest Passage .

U . S . BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U . S . banks in a quarter century , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) said .
The nation ' s 14 , 181 commercial banks had net income of 17 . 8 billion dlrs in 1986 , down slightly from 1985 ' s record 18 . 1 billion dlrs .
The total was still the second highest ever reported , but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961 .
The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country , the FDIC said .
In the East , one in 12 banks had losses last year , while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses .
Nationwide , one out of five banks reported losses , the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue .
" I don ' t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area ," FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters .
He said that while the figures were not good , they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance .
Some 44 banks have failed so far this year , twice as many as failed by this time a year ago , but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue .
On a positive note , banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year , and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest , Seidman said .
Banks ' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21 . 7 billion dlrs , a 23 pct rise from a year ago .
Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth - quarter losses totaled 22 , the FDIC said .
Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil ' s moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U . S . banks .
He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected .
But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger , Seidman said .

NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF ESSO SAF & lt ; ESSF . PA >, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries .
Exxon ' s new president Lee R . Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery .
An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries ' ability to make money .
He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985 - 86 and had last year broken even after stock losses .
The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer ' s is five mln , the spokesman added .
Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery , while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant .
Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries .

HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT & lt ; Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc > said that , due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing , it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton , Nova Scotia .
Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7 . 7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale .
It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings , which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment .
Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers ' financing difficulties .
Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade .
However , there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro - electric power generation , the company said .
The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U . S . and export markets , mainly China and India .
The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components .
Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U . S . imports of Canadian lumber , but there were encouraging signs at yearend , the company said .

GENCORP & lt ; GY > GROUP TO SEEK ANTI - GREENMAIL VOTE GAMCO Investors Inc , an affiliate of Gabelli and Co , plans to propose an anti - greenmail provision at the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31 , according to GAMCO Chairman Mario Gabelli .
Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor .
GenCorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9 . 8 pct of its stock .
Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13 - D filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6 . 5 pct of GenCorp stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates .
The stock amounts to 1 , 462 , 000 shares and most of it was reported in an earlier 13 - G filing .
A 13 - G is filed by passive investors to show holdings of more than five pct .
Earlier today , General Partners , owned by Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc , launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for GenCorp .
Analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low .
GenCorp has made no comment on the offer .
Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider spinning off all assets , other than the GenCorp broadcast properties , to shareholders .
The licenses of the broadcast properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges .
" One thing is going to be clear and that is I ' m going to the meeting and putting up " no greenmail ," Gabelli said .
Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation in the offer .
The annual meeting is to be held in Akron , Ohio .
LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN ' 87 Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [ OLBV . VI ] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181 . 5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986 , General Director Gerhard Wagner said .
Wagner told a news conference that last year ' s 34 . 3 pct rise in net profit from 135 . 1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates .
The bank , Austria ' s third largest , raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1 . 5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1 . 35 billion in 1985 .
Announcing the 1986 results , Wagner said : " We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987 .
" Laenderbank ' s balance sheet total rose five pct to 197 . 7 billion schillings against 8 . 1 pct growth in 1985 .
Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985 .
Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar ' s fall against the schilling , which is effectively pegged to the mark .
The dollar ' s weakness had wiped some 8 . 9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total .
Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank ' s London branch , which opened in April 1985 , but said that it came close to one mln stg .
On schilling lending , profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2 . 19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8 . 7 pct to 738 . 9 mln .
According to the 1987 federal budget , the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank , probably to 51 pct .
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state .

CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba ' s direct shipments to its export markets , dealers here said .
Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts .
The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop , worry over Brazil ' s export availability , and increasing Soviet demand , analysts said .
Traders said signs of Cuba ' s shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month .
Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery , and last month ' s spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes .
Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets , traders said .

AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY Air Canada ' s 54 mln U . S . dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp ' s & lt ; GEC > Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada ' s fast growing courier industry , largely dominated by U . S . companies until this year , company officials and analysts said .
State - owned Air Canada takes over the country ' s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company , & lt ; Onex Capital Corp Ltd >, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey - based Purolator Courier Corp & lt ; PCC >.
But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U . S . parent companies and likely don ' t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations .
" It ' s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time ," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented .
The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U . S . companies embroiled in a take - over or restructuring to sell - off their Canadian units to generate ready cash , said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin .
" There is a very good correlation between the U . S . parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U . S . parent either being under siege or taking someone else over ," he said .
Gelco Corp , of Minnesota , decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt , Gelco Express marketing vice president James O ' Neil told Reuters .
The sale is the first under Gelco ' s divestiture program , and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U . S . dlrs of debt by year - end , the company said .
While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures , O ' Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry , handling more than 50 , 000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year .
The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program , adopted after another Canadian Company , & lt ; Unicorp Canada Corp >, acquired a 12 . 6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company .
Last month , Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E . F . Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator ' s U . S . courier business .
For Air Canada , its acquisition of Gelco ' s Canadian courier business represents an " excellent financial investment " in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually , spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said .
The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp , of Calgary , an in - city messenger service .
It did not disclose financial terms , but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs , and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs .
She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada ' s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business .
Gelco will continue to operate with current management , independently of Air Canada , although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door - to - door courier operation .
" They ' re well run , they ' re a good investment , they ' re doing well in a growing market , and that ' s the way we want to keep it ," Szynkarsky said .
Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U . S . delivery network , generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada .
" The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue ," Hine said .
" It ' s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder , and the more sausage you can stuff through , the more money you make ," he added .
COPPER INDUSTRY ASKS LME FOR STRATEGY STATEMENT Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council ( IWCC ) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME .
In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system , industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis .
Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change ( the planned clearing system ) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry , the release said .
By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non - trade orientated markets such as Comex .
The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction , industry delegates said .
The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29 .
But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal , made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week .
A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change , the press release said .

The group , which disclosed plans on Dec 29 to seek control of the company , reserved the right to change its mind again .
GOODRICH & lt ; GR > TO PHASE OUT SOME BUSINESSES B . F . Goodrich Co said it will phase out the production of aircraft tires , missile and marine products and molded rubber products in Akron , Ohio , by the end of 1987 , laying off about 790 salaried , production , maintenance and support services employees .

PERU SHORT - TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS Peru ' s short - term foreign trade credit lines , regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial transactions , have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under the 20 - month government of president Alan Garcia .
Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters many of the credits were 90 - day .
Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in 1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings .
Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on short - term debt , including trade credit lines and on about 750 mln dlrs in so - called " working capital " credits .
Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982 , but fell in 1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks .
U . K . TO SELL OFF REMAINING 31 . 7 PCT STAKE IN BP The British Conservative government said it would sell off its remaining 31 . 7 pct shareholding in British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP . L > during the next financial year which starts on April 1 .
Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the announcement to Parliament .
He said , " The government ' s policy is to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when circumstances permit .
" As part of this policy I am now able to announce that , subject to market conditions , the government will sell its remaining shares in BP during the 1987 / 88 financial year .
" The last sale of British government shares in BP was in September 1983 .
The government currently holds some 578 . 5 mln ordinary shares in the company .
Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers for the sale .
Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in being considered for this would be interviewed in early April .
In September 1983 , the U . K . Government sold 150 mln shares in an underwritten offer for sale by tender .
The striking price then was 435 pence - 7 . 5 pct above the minimum tender price , a Treasury spokesman said .
He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the government ' s plans to privatise Rolls - Royce , in either April or May , or the sale of BAA Plc , the British airports authority which is slated for privatisation in either June or July .

Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure during 1987 will be around 118 . 5 mln rand .
The decline in gold production last year was due to a four pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade .

DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U . S . OIL INDUSTRY The U . S . Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry , hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices , and the subsequent growth in oil imports , industry analysts said .
" The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better ," said Daniel Yergin , director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , which recently completed a survey of the U . S . Congress on energy issues .
Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee .
Today U . S . Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration .
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed .
Herrington said , " I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day ( addition ) to U . S .
production .
" U . S . oil output was off to 8 . 4 mln bpd in the week of March 13 , down six pct from last year , the American Petroleum Institute said .
Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term .
Paul Mlotok , oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that " even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we ' ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17 . 50 dlrs for the year .
" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U . S . crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration .
John Lichtblau , president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said " The continuing decline in U . S . oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario .
But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U . S . government policy .
" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time .
" Lowering the producing industry ' s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant ( to output ) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs .
" Lichtblau said .
But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U . S . are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee .
Ronald Tappmeyer , president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors , said , " The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation .
" The association represents some 1 , 300 drilling and oil service companies .
The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle .
Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman , Orval Hansen , showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry .
At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests .
But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise .
Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U . S . requirements " is a critical , symbolic level .
If they ( imports ) move above that level , a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action .
" But Lichtblau , in a telephone interview , said , " a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 .
In 1986 U . S . oil imports rose to 33 pct of u . s . energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 , he added .
TEXSTYRENE & lt ; FOAM > SUSPENDS PREFERRED PAYMENTS Texstyrene Corp said it has suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its 9 . 5 pct convertible exchangeable preferred stock .
The suspension effects the March 15 payment , and it said it does not expect to pay preferred dividends in the forseeable future .
It said the payments were suspended because of certain covenants contained in its loan agreements .
A spokesman said the company ' s loss of 2 , 115 , 000 dlrs for the first 11 months as a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans , leading to the suspension .
The maker of foam cups , food containers and other products said it had 733 , 332 outstanding preferred shares , which had been privately placed .
The dividend payments on the shares amounted to 1 , 045 , 000 dlrs per year , the spokesman said .
( RPT ) U . S . SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD U . S . tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96 , 000 tonnes in the year started March 1 , a government official said .
The agreement by the seven - member Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices .
Following the accord , ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile .
" We don ' t think that ( the U . S . government ) has a large influence in the ( tin ) market at this stage of the game ," said Thomas O ' Donnell , Director of International Commodities at the State Department .
Last year the United States released about 4 , 900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms .

SHULTZ SAYS U . S . PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE Asked what the U . S . State Department ' s policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow , Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U . S . products must be competitive in the world market .
" If we are going to sell our products , whatever they may be , wheat or anything else , then we have to meet the market ," Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers .
" We have to be competitive .
It ' s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else .
They just aren ' t ," he said .
" That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets , and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better ," Shultz told the Wheat Growers .
Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife , he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced .
Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices .
Soviet officials have said they would buy U . S . wheat if it were competitively priced .
Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue .

ARGENTINE MAIZE , SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday , trade sources said .
Soybean production for 1986 / 87 is now estimated to reach between 7 . 7 and eight mln tonnes , versus 7 . 8 to 8 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8 . 4 mln tonnes estimated in mid - February .
But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8 . 5 to 12 . 7 pct greater than last year ' s total of 7 . 1 mln tonnes , according to official figures , and would be a new record .
The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares and increased 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct compared to the 3 . 3 mln hectares planted last year .
The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean - producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province .
The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty , especially in Cordoba .
Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops , since rainfall was slight in most main soybean - producing areas .
Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province , totalling between one and 10 mm .
There was no recorded rain in other grain - producing provinces .
With clear skies and seasonable temperatures , fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks , allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize , sunflower and sorghum harvesting .
Crops were considered in generally good condition , though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long - term damage .
The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted , compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago .
Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3 . 58 to 3 . 78 mln hectares , down two to seven pct from the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest .
Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes , versus 10 to 10 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago .
The new figure is 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the 12 . 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest , according to official figures .
The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area , versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago .
Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , or 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct lower than the record 3 . 14 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest .
The current harvest ' s volume was again expected to be between 2 . 3 and 2 . 6 mln tonnes , or 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct lower than last harvest ' s record 4 . 1 mln tonnes .
Yields varied widely from area to area , and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and , consequently , on total production volume .
The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area , compared to four to six pct a week ago .
Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1 . 2 and 1 . 3 mln hectares , or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct lower than the 1 . 4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest .
Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes again this week , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest ' s total volume of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes .
RECENT U . S . OIL DEMAND UP 2 . 3 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U . S . oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 2 . 3 pct in the four weeks ended March 13 to 16 . 49 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) from 16 . 11 mln in the same period a year ago , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) said .
In its weekly petroleum status report , the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was up 2 . 9 pct in the period to 3 . 43 mln bpd from 3 . 33 mln a year earlier .
Gasoline demand averaged 6 . 93 mln bpd , up 4 . 0 pct from 6 . 67 mln last year , while residual fuel demand was 1 . 31 mln bpd , off 7 . 9 pct from 1 . 42 mln , the EIA said .
Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8 . 36 mln bpd , down 8 . 1 pct from 9 . 10 mln a year ago , and gross daily crude imports ( excluding those for the SPR ) averaged 3 . 70 mln bpd , up 24 . 8 pct from 2 . 96 mln , the EIA said .
Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11 . 92 mln bpd , up 1 . 0 pct from 11 . 80 mln a year earlier , it said .
Year - to - date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA ' s Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available , the agency said .

AMSTUTZ SEES MORE BULLISH WHEAT OUTLOOK IN 1987 U . S . Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply / demand situation has become more bullish recently because of developments in the world market and increased consumption .
Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee , Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook .
He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year , primarily for feed use .
There are also reports from Australia , Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced , he said .
Furthermore , he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union .
" It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance than a year ago ," Amstutz said .
ARGENTINE OIL , GAS PRODUCTION FALL IN FEBRUARY Argentina ' s total oil and gas production fell 9 . 4 pct in February to 2 . 78 mln cubic metres from January ' s total of 3 . 11 mln cubic metres , the state oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales ( YPF ) reported .
A YPF statement blamed the drop on momentary problems owing to the summer season but gave no further details .
February ' s production figure fell slightly short of YPF ' s target figure of 2 . 90 mln cubic metres .
Oil production totalled 1 . 76 mln cubic metres last month and natural gas production 1 . 02 mln cubic metres , down from 1 . 95 and 1 . 15 mln cubic metres in January , respectively .
U . S . SOYBEANS HAVE COMPETITIVE PROBLEM - AMSTUTZ Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill , U . S .
Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said .
Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a " squeeze " because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction .
As a result , he said U . S .- produced soybeans " have a price problem " in competing with other soybean producing countries .
Amstutz called the situation a " dilemma " for the USDA , and said " we have spent hours in ASCS ( Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service ) looking at this .
" He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation .

FLEET & lt ; FLT > AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp & lt ; NOR >, ranked as the largest U . S . banking merger , can be completed by the beginning of 1988 , according to an executive of Fleet .
Robert Lougee , director of corporate communications for Rhode Island - based Fleet , told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state ' s reciprocal bank law to Jan 1 , 1988 from July one .
The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature .
The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal , worth about 1 . 3 billion dlrs , would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down .
" If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned ," Lougee said .
He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state .
He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law , which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England , can be amended .
Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp .
If the Connecticut law is not amended in time , Lougee said , an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions .
The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants .
Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany , N . Y .- based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis .
The U . S . Supreme Court decided in mid - 1985 to permit the mergers .
Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as " a partnership of two companies .
" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger .
Norstar holders will receive 1 . 2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet ' s previously announced two - for - one split .
Fleet shares closed today at 59 - 1 / 2 , up 1 / 8 , giving the deal an indicated value of 1 . 3 billion dlrs .
That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles - based Security Pacific Corp & lt ; SPC > and Seattle ' s Rainier Bancorpartion & lt ; RBAN >.
The West Coast deal , announced about four weeks ago , is worth an estimated 1 . 2 billion dlrs .
Chemical New York Corp ' s & lt ; CHL > acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1 . 2 billion dlrs , making it similar in size to the Security Pacific - Rainer deal .
The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co & lt ; WFC > and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1 . 1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700 - 800 mln dlr range .
" It ' s a merger of equals ," said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp .
He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19 . 63 dlrs per share , while Fleet ' s book value was 28 . 02 dlrs .
Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60 ' s while Fleet ' s Terrence Murray is in his late 40 ' s .
He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post .
Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet ' s earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today .
He noted that Fleet has a " teriffic reputation " after having diversified in a number of financial areas .
Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages .
The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U . S . Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City .
Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined .
The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a " lock - up " option designed to deter other acquirers .
Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24 . 99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding .

VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES Financial analysts see little chance that U . S . interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week .
" We got a little volatility Wednesday ," said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey .
" But for the moment we ' re still in a trading range .
" Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U . S . economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state , the analysts said .
" It ( the bond market ) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility ," said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky .
" It needs something , but it ' s not going to be news about the economy ," he said .
Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy .
But even Wednesday , when fed funds were below six pct , the dollar strong and oil on the soft side , bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs , he said .
In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy , Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace .
" The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1 ," Quinn said .
Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested .
If Japanese investment in U . S . securities does materialize at the start of Japan ' s fiscal year , domestic funds may also flow into the bond market , he said .
" We could get a stiff rally , possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7 - 1 / 8 pct ," compared to the current yield of about 7 . 5 pct , Quinn said .
In the meantime , even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures .
The Treasury ' s announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures .
" I ' d be surprised if supply pushed us out of it ( the trading range )," Lacey said .
U . S . HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U . S . trade woes .
The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U . S . military security .
Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U . S . companies could not sell abroad .
The issue has been the subject of administration debate .
The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U . S . exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered .
Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U . S . companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices .
Their separate proposals , some of them conflicting , will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April .
Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd . to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd ' s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp ., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan ' s authority to block foreign takeovers of U . S . companies .
Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U . S . economic or national security interests .
" We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security ," subcommittee chairman James Florio , a New Jersey Democrat said .
The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices .
The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U . S . companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction .
U . S . firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction .
At the urging of the U . S . recording industry , the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product -- digital audio recorders .
Meeting in closed session , the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U . S . telecommunications products .
Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U . S . companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U . S . copyright and patent laws .
CHILEAN COPPER WORKERS ELECT LEFT - WING LEADERS Chilean left - wing leaders were elected by the copper workers union for the first time since the left - wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a 1973 coup .
Nicanor Araya , a member of the Popular Democratic Movement ( MDP ), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of Copperworkers ( CTC ), which groups 22 , 000 workers employed in the state - owned copper mines , union officials said .
Other members of the MDP , which includes the communist party and a faction of the socialist party , took five of the principal positions on the union ' s directorate .
The state - owned copper company of Chile ( CODELCO ) produces around 90 pct of the country ' s copper output of some one mln tonnes per year .
Chile is the world ' s leading copper exporter and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income .
The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union ' s directorate in elections earlier this month , with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents .
But the left - wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations .
Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October .
Seguel , a christian democrat and Chile ' s best - known union leader , said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating .
The labour leader , who now heads the inter - union national workers command ( CNT ), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO following a strike in 1983 .
The strike , the only copper industry stoppage staged in the past 13 years , marked the start of a wave of protests against the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet .
CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union leader when no longer employed by the company .
GENCORP & lt ; GY > BIDDER PLANS SALE OF AEROSPACE UNIT & lt ; General Partners >, controlled by privately - held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc , said plans to sell GenCorp Inc ' s aerospace and soft drink bottling divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp ' s aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer .
General Partners , which launched the surprise tender offer today , said it already 2 , 180 , 608 shares of GenCorp , or 9 . 4 pct of the total outstanding common stock .
General Partners , which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2 . 5 billion dlrs , also said it plans to continue GenCorp ' s policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses .
It said it would also continue GenCorp ' s policy of trying to sell its New York - area television station WOR to MCA Inc & lt ; MCA > for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co & lt ; DIS > for 217 mln dlrs .
But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp ' s headquarter in Akron , Ohio .
General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp ' s plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products .
But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp ' s operations after it completes the merger .
Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer , General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N . A .
and other banks .
It also said it would seek 1 . 25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes .
In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds , which was included in the SEC filing , General Partners officials said they were " confident of our ability to promptly obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer materials .
" " For this reason , we do not forsee any obstacles to a prompt consummation of the transaction ," General Partners said .
Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer for GenCorp .
MONSANTO & lt ; MTC > SAYS DEBT WAS CUT IN 1986 Mondanto Co said it has paid off two - thirds of the debt from its 2 . 8 billion - dlr acquisition of G . D . Searle and Co by the end of 1986 .
This lowered the company ' s debt - to - capitalization ratio from 45 pct at the end of 1985 to 35 pct , it said .
The company also said that chemical sales accounted for 52 pct of its sales in 1986 , down from 70 pct in 1981 .
This underscores its strategy of shifting away from low profit commodity chemicals in mature markets into higher value chemical businesses in high growth areas , it said .

BOLIVIAN TIN MINERS START HUNGER STRIKE About 9 , 000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for higher wages , a miners union spokesman said .
Victor Lopez , executive secretary of the miners union , told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas .
The government has charged that the strike by the miners union , crippled by massive layoffs , is part of a left - wing destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker , who arrives on a four - day official tour on Friday .
But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for more government investment in Comibol .
The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has streamlined the deficit - ridden state mining corporation laying off about 20 , 000 miners , two - thirds of the workforce , following a collapse of the international tin price in 1985 .
CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT European sugar output on the basis of three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white value down on last year although yields do vary widely from year to year , broker C Czarnikow said in its market review .
European Community sowings are likely to be down compared with last year .
There have been suggestions these sowings might respond to the recent upsurge in world prices , but Czarnikow said " it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known .
" The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates which put W Germany , the Netherlands and USSR lower but Hungary , Romania , Poland , Turkey and Yugoslavia higher .

CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7 . 5 MLN TONNES Cuban sugar output this season ( 1986 / 87 ) is put at around 7 . 5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C . Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review .
Allowing for around 700 , 000 tonnes for the current year ' s domestic usage it would leave around 6 . 8 mln tonnes for export of which , Czarnikow estimates , about 3 . 7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR , 1 . 530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non - socialist bloc destinations .
Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986 / 87 production at 8 . 75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3 . 7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14 . 2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1 . 75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market .
Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity , Czarnikow said .

CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR The U . S .
Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U . S . flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference .
Melvin Sims , USDA ' s general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a " memorandum of understanding " on cargo preference .
Under a 1985 farm bill provision , the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U . S . flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988 .
The increased cost of using U . S . vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA .
However , USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money .
The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter , USDA officials said .
Tom Kay , administrator of the USDA ' s Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U . S . vessels has been difficult to meet .
" As the tonnage ( required under cargo preference ) goes up , its going to be harder and harder to meet ," Kay said .
Two farm state Congressmen , Pat Roberts ( R - Kan .) and Glenn English ( D - Okla .) said cargo preference makes U . S . farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated .
In the past , farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U . S . shipping fleet .

FORMER N . Z .
PREMIER CALLS FOR CHEAPER CURRENCY Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon , an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N . Z .
Dollar , said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued .
Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate should be around 48 U . S .
Cents instead of the current 57 cents .
" A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10 .
Perhaps around about 48 cents ," he said .
The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents .
Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party , and party leaders , with an eye to general elections to be held by September , have rejected his calls for a managed float .
He said the dollar was high because of " grossly excessive " interest rates for government stock .
" I know of no other country which is implementing such a free floating policy ," he added .
" There is widespread agreement internationally that we have no alternative to floating currencies in the short to medium term .
But we need more effective methods of managing them so as to limit the volatility which has caused so much concern and damage .

INDONESIA SEES LIMITED CHOICES ON ECONOMY Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices , Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency .
" If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much , such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies , it might create negative effects not only on price increases , but also on the balance of payments ," he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan .
Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit .
Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries , which are centered in Sumatra .
" I see Sumatra has great potential , as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number ," he said , according to the agency .
Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year ' s fall in crude prices .
It has projected its current account deficit will widen to over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending March 31 from 1 . 8 billion in 1985 / 86 .

AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australia ' s gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data , private economists polled by Reuters said .
Real GDP rose 1 . 1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 , after rising 0 . 2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1 . 1 pct a year earlier .
Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending , they said .
Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter , while imports rose only 2 . 9 pct , Statistics Bureau figures show .
Consumer spending declined 0 . 6 pct and government spending by 0 . 2 .
Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government ' s aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working .
However , he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments .
Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export - driven .
But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics .
The economists ' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra .
Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit , notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports .
A further 3 . 5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages , prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia ' s competitiveness , he said .
" It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern ," he added .
DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS & lt ; DPCZ > SEES EARNINGS GROWTH Diagnostic Products Corp president and chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in 1987 as the company has for the past five years .
" We expect the same performance in net income over the next five years as we have had in the past ," Ziering said .
Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27 pct per year growth in earnings per share .
For 1986 the company had net income of 6 . 3 mln dlrs , or 1 . 07 dlrs per share , vs 3 . 9 mln dlrs , or 73 cts per share in 1985 .
Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic test kits .
Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company ' s exports sales as well as accelerated market penetration .
Ziering said he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year , which , depending on approval , should also help earnings growth .
Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected the company ' s taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net income in 1987 .

SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY ' S INFLATION FIGURE Sweden ' s rate of inflation during January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in calculating the figures , the Central Bureau of Statistics said .
The January rise in consumer prices was 1 . 0 pct instead of the previously announced 1 . 3 pct , the bureau said , without explaining how the error arose .
Consumer prices in February rose 0 . 3 pct compared with 0 . 1 pct in February last year , the bureau said .
The total inflation rate so far this year is therefore 1 . 3 pct , allowing for January ' s revised figures , it added .
Year - on - year inflation rose to 3 . 4 pct in February , against a revised 3 . 2 pct in January and a year - on - year rate of 5 . 3 pct in February 1986 , the bureau said .
The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4 , the bureau added .
TAIWAN STEEL FIRM SEES LOWER EXPORTS , MORE OUTPUT State - owned & lt ; China Steel Corp > said its steel exports will drop to some 600 , 000 tonnes in the year ending June 30 , 1987 from more than 810 , 000 in 1985 / 86 .
Production by the company , Taiwan ' s largest steel maker , is expected to rise to 3 . 33 mln tonnes from 3 . 27 mln , a spokesman told Reuters .
He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwan dollar , which has eroded the competitiveness of the company ' s products against those from South Korea .
The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion project which calls for a boost in production to 5 . 65 mln tonnes a year from the current level .
The project , costing 52 . 3 billion Taiwan dlrs , will be completed by April 1988 , two months ahead of the targetted date , he said .
The spokesman said the company exports its products to Japan , Southeast Asia , Hong Kong , the U . S ., The Middle East and Africa .

CURRENCIES COULD INFLUENCE BULLION AGAIN - MONTAGU Currency fluctuations may reassert their influence on the bullion market in the near future , bullion bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report .
But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any reactions to movements on foreign exchanges .
" OPEC ' s failure to address the recent decline in oil prices remains a worrying factor however , and on balance it appears that the market should be approached cautiously ," Montagu said .
The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable long - term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar .

NORTH KOREA TO RESURRECT GOLD MINE TO REPAY DEBT Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo - based North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two years from 600 pounds at present , said Li Sangsu , a spokesman for & lt ; Unzan Mine Development Co >, the venture partner .
Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang ' s 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies , Li added .
" We expect this mine to be worth about 2 , 000 billion yen in gold deposits ," he said .
The mine , started in 1896 by a U . S . Company , is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area , 94 miles north of Pyongyang , Li said .
Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields .
" Up to now , the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment .
" The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors .
Earlier this year , Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish .

EC FARM LOBBIES BACK OILS AND FATS " TAX " PLAN The European Community ( EC ) farmers ' and farm cooperatives lobbies , Copa and Cogeca , have backed the EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism , claiming it would not harm consumers .
In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans , current president of the EC Council of Ministers , they said the mechanism , often referred to as a tax , would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances .
This would have been the case in May 1984 , when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne , they noted .
If such price stabilisation is not implemented , EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences , the letter , made available to journalists , said .
Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats .
The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced , and possibly to become a subsidy , as world soya oil prices rose from present levels .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY Higher world oil prices , coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity , could lift Saudi Arabia ' s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits , bankers and diplomats said .
The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector .
Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct , the first rise since 1982 .
But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long .
Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC ' s newly - established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price .
Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day ( bpd ), well down on Saudi Arabia ' s OPEC quota of 4 . 13 mln set for the first half of 1987 .
King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC ' s new - found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom ' s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy .
Saudi Arabia , still the world ' s largest oil exporter , is a hugely wealthy country .
But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll .
Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8 . 6 pct in 1985 .
Oil revenue last year , when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel , probably totalled no more than 17 . 5 billion dlrs , compared to a peak 101 . 8 billion in 1981 .
" Austerity is still the watchword , but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ...
The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects ," a diplomat said .
In the short - term , the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves , still put at around 100 billion dlrs .
But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely .
Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term .
It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy .
Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to " tough it out " on the oil front even if that means a short - term depletion of reserves .
The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52 . 7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay .
The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out .
Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al - Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year .
" It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy ," he said .
Reserves were built up during the late 1970 ' s and early 1980 ' s when Saudi Arabia ' s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary .
The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom ' s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom .
Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced , markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back .
The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply .
The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks , hit hard by non - performing loans to the corporate sector , have become highly selective in extending new credit .
Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation ' s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment .
Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit .
As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector , one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad .
EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS The rebate granted at yesterday ' s EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers ' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc , EC Commission officials said .
The maximum rebate of 44 . 819 European currency units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos was 1 . 3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention .
The rebate at last week ' s tender was 2 . 5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed , the officials said .
The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates .
They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores .
Payment for it is due five weeks later , and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar , the officials said .
The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar , it is determined to immediately resell it , a move which would drive down market prices further .
They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales .
" We think they realise they have gone too far ," one official said .

FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS Media group John Fairfax Ltd & lt ; FFXA . S > said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system .
Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2 . 3 pct to 25 . 94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25 . 35 mln a year earlier although pre - tax profit rose 9 . 1 pct to 48 . 30 mln from 44 . 29 mln .
Net would have risen 10 . 1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits , paid by employers and not the recipients , the company said in a statement .
Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings .
It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors .
Fairfax said its flagship dailies , The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age , boosted advertising volume , as did the Australian Financial Review , and posted extremely satisfactory performances .
Magazines also performed strongly .
But an 8 . 9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4 . 0 pct rise in revenue , it said .
Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96 . 11 mln dlr capital dividend from & lt ; Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd > ( AAP ) after the sale of AAP ' s " B " shares in Reuters Holdings Plc & lt ; RTRS . L >.
This accounted for the 89 . 32 mln dlr extraordinary profit .
Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year .
Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV - Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings .

JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States , MITI officials said .
The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut - price Japanese chips to Asian markets .
Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1 .
The pact , agreed last year , calls on Japan to stop selling cut - price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus .
MITI , anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement , has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export .
Last month , the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct .
To meet that request , they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter .
If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June , second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year .
MITI officials , who declined to be identified , said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback .
One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U . S . Competition just as markets there are picking up .
MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy - handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan / U . S .
Chip pact .
U . K . CLEARING BANK LENDING RISES 1 . 6 BILLION STG Clearing bank sterling lending to the U . K .
Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by an underlying , seasonally - adjusted 1 . 6 billion stg after a 1 . 2 billion stg rise in January , the Banking Information Service said .
The unadjusted rise was 1 . 31 billion stg , compared with an 813 mln stg increase in January .
The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of 1 . 6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of about 1 . 0 billion stg .
Of the increase , 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal lending , which the Banking Information Service said was taken up entirely by lending for home purchases .
Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about 182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month .
Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg , and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg .
The Banking Information Service said February fell within the governmemnt tax season , so much of the lending was probably the result of industry ' s need to pay its tax bills .
Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1 . 1 billion stg in February and by a seasonally - adjusted 1 . 75 billion stg .
Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln .
U . K . UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY Unemployment in the U . K . Fell a provisional seasonally - adjusted 44 , 100 in February , to total 3 . 07 mln or 11 . 1 pct of the workforce , the Employment Department said .
In January , seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a revised 1 , 100 to 11 . 3 pct , it said .
Initially the January position was reported as flat .
The unadjusted jobless total , including school leavers , fell to 3 . 23 mln , or 11 . 7 pct , from 3 . 30 mln , 11 . 9 pct , in January .
February was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted unemployment registered a fall .
It was at a peak of 11 . 7 pct last summer .
Lord Young , the Employment Minister , said there appeared little doubt the monthly fall , which has been running at about 20 , 000 , will continue .
A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and continued the downward trend seen in the past six months .
He said the February fall was spread throughout the country and among men and women .
STERLING M3 UP 2 - 1 / 4 PCT IN FEBRUARY , M0 DOWN The main measure of U . K . Broad money , sterling M3 , grew a provisional , seasonally adjusted 2 - 1 / 4 pct in February after a rise of 1 . 1 pct in January , the Bank of England said .
The narrow measure , M0 , fell a provisional adjusted 3 / 4 to one pct after a 0 . 6 pct drop in January , the Bank said .
Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18 - 3 / 4 to 19 pct in the 12 months to February against 17 . 6 pct in January while M0 rose four to 4 - 1 / 4 pct after a 5 . 2 pct rise in January .
Seasonally adjusted , sterling bank lending grew 2 . 9 billion stg after a January rise of 1 . 75 billion .
Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 , bank lending to the private sector expanded 2 . 6 billion stg after a 1 . 4 billion rise in January , the Bank said .
The public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR ) contracted by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3 . 7 billion stg in January .
Funding - debt sales to the non - bank private sector and external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after a 1 . 5 billion stg rise in January .
Of this , central government debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln stg after a 1 . 3 billion expansion in January , the Bank said .
Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by 300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1 . 3 billion stg in January , the Bank said .
Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1 - 3 / 4 to two pct in February after a drop of 0 . 8 pct in January .
On the same basis , the figures showed a drop of about 1 - 1 / 2 pct in MO in February after a sharp 6 - 1 / 2 pct fall in January .
The Bank said it would publish full , final figures on March 30 .
The Bank said non - bank private sector holdings of public sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg .
Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg , the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was therefore about flat , the Bank said .
It said seasonally adjusted bank lending , at about 2 . 9 billion stg in February , compared with an average of about 2 . 6 billion stg a month over the preceding six months .
U . K . EARNINGS RISE 7 . 6 PCT IN YEAR TO JANUARY U . K . Average earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 7 . 6 pct in the year to end - January after a 7 . 4 pct rise in the year to December , the Department of Employment said .
The underlying rise was 7 . 5 pct after 7 . 75 pct in December .
The January index , base 1980 , was set at a provisional seasonally adjusted 190 . 4 , down from 193 . 4 in December .
The underlying rise , adjusted for factors such as back - pay and timing variations , had been steady at 7 . 5 pct from October 1985 to October 1986 .
Unit wage costs in U . K . Manufacturing industry rose 3 . 3 pct in the three months to end January , on a year - on - year basis , after a 3 . 1 pct rise in the three months to end December , the Department of Employment said .
In January , the unit wage rise in manufacturing industries was 3 . 6 pct , unchanged from the December rise .
The Department said the decline in the underlying rate of rise in earnings reflected the reduced significance of bonus payments in January compared with December .
The actual increase reflected teacher pay settlements and industrial action in the transport and communications sectors in January 1987 .

About 6 , 000 miners resumed work at the Grootvlei gold mine east of Johannesburg after protesting the transfer of colleagues to other jobs at the same mine , owners General Mining Union Corp Ltd & lt ; GENM . J > said .
The union said about 1 , 000 mineworkers at a new coal facility owned by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd & lt ; ANGL . J > also returned to their jobs on Tuesday .
The workers at Anglo ' s Vaal Colliery south of Johannesburg had struck to protest the alleged refusal of officials of the South African homeland of Transkei to allow miners to attend a funeral in the homeland , a union spokesman said .
NIPPON LIFE SEEKING TIE WITH U . S . SECURITIES HOUSE & lt ; Nippon Life Insurance Co > is pursing a possible link with an American securities house to expand its overseas investment portfolio , a company spokesman said .
But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in & lt ; Shearson Lehman Brothers >, an investment banking unit of American Express Co & lt ; AXP >.
He said the firm started to sound out several U . S . Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects , but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm .
Nippon Life , Japan ' s largest life insurer , also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit , & lt ; Nissei International America >, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada , Singapore , the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year , he said .
These moves are in line with its long - term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company ' s assets are growing .
The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of U . S . Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there , the spokesman added .
U . K . MONEY MARKET GIVEN 181 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it provided the money market with 181 mln stg in assistance this morning .

PHILIPPINES ' LIQUIDITY RISES , LOAN DEMAND FALLS Liquidity in the Philippines rose in December while loan demand and short - term lending rates fell , the Central Bank said .

Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial bank reserves , the official said .
The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22 . 19 billion pesos at the end of December , when reserves required were 21 . 59 billion .
She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos , compared with a deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1 . 64 billion at the end of 1985 , reflected political uncertainty in the last quarter of 1986 .
Reserve money , the total available to monetary authorities , was a provisional 52 . 58 billion pesos at the end of 1986 .
This was 5 . 19 pct up from 49 . 98 billion at the end of November and 41 . 85 pct up from 37 . 09 billion in December 1985 .

BUNDESBANK LEAVES CREDIT POLICIES UNCHANGED The Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged after today ' s regular meeting of its council , a spokesman said in answer to enquiries .

NO FRENCH REFLATION , SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy , sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said .
Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac ' s spokesman Denis Baudouin , who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of " relaunching " the economy .
This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U - turn , but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move .
The sources today said the government ' s policy remained one of " recovery ," or sound finances and greater efficiency .
They said that while 8 . 6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital , 21 . 4 billion francs , or two - thirds , will go toward paying off national debt .
Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions , they added .
The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country ' s internal debt , expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1 , 300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product .
Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5 , 000 billion francs last year , broadly in line with earlier forecasts .
Real GDP will grow by up to 2 . 5 pct .
The sources said that with France ' s economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners , the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies .
U . S . CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING , M - 1 Brisk increases in personal income and consumption are to appear in February data released today , but the bond market ' s recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected , economists said .
Personal income is forecast to rise by 0 . 6 to 0 . 8 pct , compared with no change in January , while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1 . 4 to 1 . 6 pct , reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January .
M - 1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released .
An increase of some 2 . 3 billion dlrs is expected .
Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income , led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February .
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337 , 000 jobs in February , the average workweek lengthened by 0 . 6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts , he noted in a report .
Vigorous spending on durable goods last month , especially cars , foreshadow a rise of at least 1 . 5 pct in consumption , he added .
The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday , with the 30 - year Treasury bond slipping just 7 / 32 to 99 - 28 / 32 for a yield of 7 . 51 pct .
Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range , desperately seeking direction .
" Seasonally adjusted , it ' s already December in the bond market ," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc . Paul Boltz of T . Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7 . 5 pct , despite some signs of a stronger economy , probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued .
But he warned that this assumption might not be justified .
" It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits , and now that it has learned that lesson , it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead ," Boltz said in a report .
After trading late yesterday at 5 - 15 / 16 pct , Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5 - 15 / 16 , six pct .
U . S . DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed , but say the U . S . Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced .
Wayne Bennett , the American Soybean Association ' s first vice president , told a news conference the U . S . Administration would not hesitate to retaliate , but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation .
U . S . Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U . S .
Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed , Bennett said .
The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association ( NSPA ) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support .
Bennett said West Germany , Britain , the Netherlands , Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax , but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue .
" Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically , but that is not correct because we would hit back ," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said .
This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced , he said .
Reed pointed out the U . S . Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U . S .
In 1962 , he said .
Under the zero duty bindings pact U . S . Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty - free .

NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF - HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide .
On April one , NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate , after the exchange closes , a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market , according to an exchange spokeswoman .
" This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world ," said said Thomas McKiernan , McKiernan and Co chairman .
Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices , McKiernan explained .
The expanded program " will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does ," said Frank Capozza , secretary of Century Resources Inc .
The rule change , which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX , is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U . S . energy futures , according to traders and analysts .
Currently , at least one trader in this transaction , called an exchange for physical or EFP , must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction .
Under the new arrangement , neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day , according to exchange officials .
When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December , NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden , said , " Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for , in effect , 24 - hour trading .
" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February , according to a CFTC spokeswoman .
AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > MAY SELL SHEARSON STAKE American Express Co said it and its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc subsidiary have been holding talks on the possible equity investment in Shearson Lehman by & lt ; Nippon Life Insurance Co > of Japan .

The company said its board is scheduled to meet March 27 for its regular monthly sessions .
American Express said it is continuing to evaluate various courses of action of strategic importance to Shearson Lehman in addition to the possible investment by Nippon Life .
It said the options range from expanding Shearson ' s capacity to meet international competition , to broadening further its access to capital .
The company also said , " All the courses of action under study reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson Lehman in American Express ' worldwide financial services strategy .

S . AFRICA ' S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER The financial rand , widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa , appears headed above 30 U . S .
Cents , dealers and bank economists said .
The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29 . 50 cents , due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites - only election on May 6 , they added .
It has risen about two cents this week alone .
" Another factor is that banks in London , where the main market is based , are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future ," one economist said .
Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains .
After reaching 30 cents , " There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks ," one dealer said .
There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand , holding stable at 48 cents , and the financial rand were staying firm , banking sources said .
A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said : " The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas .
" One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand ' s rise .
Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa ' s long - term government bonds and " semi - gilts " or securities in partly government - owned firms , many with yields as high as 30 pct .
They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands .
" This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand ," a dealer said , adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply .
The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country .

OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world , and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies .
Results of the study , which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries , were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified .
The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979 - 81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent , PSE .
The study shows that on dairy products Japan ' s PSE , or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage , averaged 83 . 3 pct over 1979 - 81 , with the European Community at 68 . 8 pct and the United States 48 . 2 pct .
For wheat Japan ' s PSE averaged 95 . 8 pct , the EC 28 . 1 and the U . S . 17 . 2 .
Japan ' s rice PSE was 68 . 8 pct compared to the EC 13 . 6 and the U . S . 5 . 4 pct , the OECD calculations show .
In coarse grains , Japan ' s subsidies reached 107 . 1 pct compared with 27 . 9 pct for the EC and 13 . 1 pct for the U . S . Japan ' s beef subsidy was 54 . 9 pct versus 52 . 7 pct for the EC and 9 . 5 pct for the U . S ., OECD concluded .
For sugar , Japan ' s PSE was 48 . 4 pct versus 27 . 9 pct in the EC and 13 . 1 pct for the U . S ., the study shows .
The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada , Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U . S ., EC and Japan , the sources said .
Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil , two major developing country producers of commodities , were not included in the OECD work .
Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon , perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May .
Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva .
British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture .
He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels , which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture .
However , the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers , officials familiar with the study said .
The U . S . Agriculture Department ' s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982 - 84 .
In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD ' s , in part because farm policies in both the U . S . and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 - 84 from the OECD base period of 1979 - 81 , U . S . officials said .
For example , the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 - 84 , at 25 to 49 pct , than in the EC , at zero to nine pct .
French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale , citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn , told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC .
However , the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U . S . now because of increases since 1984 .
Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels , a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation .
The updated calculations , which may take several months to complete , are expected to show substantial increases in U . S . subsidy levels for sugar because the U . S . imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry .
U . S . subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill , which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice , officials added .

SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND Swissair & lt ; SWSZ . Z > reported a 5 . 8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64 . 5 mln Swiss francs and said that , in line with its new , flexible dividend policy , it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38 .
President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year ' s figure , but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate .
The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair ' s core flying business last year , against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year , he said .
The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales , compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985 .
Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year , although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC - 10s .
Gross profit for 1986 reached 340 . 5 mln francs , with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation .
Gross profits for the previous year had been 382 . 5 mln francs , with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation , including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation .
Staubli said the 1986 result , well below predictions made this time last year , suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations , in particular the strength of the Swiss franc .
While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices , there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies .
" Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin ," he said .
" Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines .

COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting which opened here today , delegates said .
Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving .
" The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week ," Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists .
Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations " optimistic and realistic .
" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January , with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time .
The existing buffer stock of about 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen , with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs .
The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi - annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices .
Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations .
The council broke for lunch , and reconvenes at 1500 hrs .
A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs , when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed - out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week , delegates said .
Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn , and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme .
The draft proposal included three principles : a limit to non - member cocoa comprising the buffer stock , an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa , and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock , delegates said .
During the morning council session , the Ivory Coast delegation gave " an open minded statement " that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible , Baron said .
Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon , chairman of the ICCO council , was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks , Baron said .
Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place .
Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today , but could arrive this afternoon , delegates said .

NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold , a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities .
Over the past three weeks , Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions , drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year .
And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse - First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character , though they are aimed at a less professional market .
The market is still small .
Taken together , the four American - led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs .
But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future .
Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank ( Switzerland ) AG said : " The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long - term investment in gold with limited risk .
" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27 , following it up with a second issue less than a week later .
The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA .
The idea found some quick copies .
Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co - led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty ( Switzerland ) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York .
The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce , the same price as the underlying commodity , to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank .
The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months , in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U . S . Markets .
The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U . S . Consumer prices for January , when a jump of 0 . 7 pct raised again the threat of inflation .
" Many people are worried about inflation again ," said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs .
" Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold .
" The gold market , having seen strong gains in 1986 , has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks .
But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited .
Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland .
" People here understand gold , and they understand warrants ," he said .
Citicorp ( Switzerland ) pioneered warrants with a series of equity - linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years , and last autumn , Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens , and to play it with higher leverage .
But after a quick flurry of issues , that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks .
The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums , but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market .
Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank ' s issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium .
The issue , for five ounces at 425 dlrs , was priced at 955 Swiss francs , making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct .
Using a Black Sholes options model , he said the issue ' s long , 4 . 3 - year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24 . 5 pct for the option to pay off , which he claimed was lower than the other issues .
But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science .
And each bank , using its own model , put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct .
Whatever the calculation , the issues have received a warm welcome from investors .
Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand , even among small investors , who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece .
" The most sophisticated ones wouldn ' t buy these because the premiums are too high ," he said .

U . S . ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL - TAX CHANGE Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27 . 5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production .
The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code .
Herrington told a meeting of the Mid - Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year .
The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday .
Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option : " that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer .
" He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U . S . economy .

U . S .
PERSONAL INCOME ROSE 0 . 9 PCT IN FEBRUARY U . S . personal income rose 0 . 9 pct , or 32 . 4 billion dlrs , in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3 , 581 . 3 billion dlrs , the Commerce Department said .
The increase followed a revised 0 . 2 pct rise in personal income during January .
Earlier , the department estimated January personal income was unchanged .
The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase since a 1 . 2 pct rise in April 1986 , the department said .
It attributed last month ' s rise to several factors , including subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises .
The department said personal consumption expenditures were up during February by 1 . 7 pct or 49 . 1 billion dlrs to 2 , 855 . 9 billion dlrs after falling by 58 . 4 billion dlrs or two pct in January .
Purchases of durable goods were up 24 . 8 billion dlrs last month after decreasing by 69 . 7 billion dlrs in January with sales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February increase and the January decline , the department said .
Purchases of nondurables rose 10 . 7 billion dlrs in February after a 300 mln dlr increase in January .
The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were up 15 . 6 billion dlrs in February after an 8 . 6 billion dlr rise in January .
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2 . 4 billion dlrs last month after rising 1 . 9 billion dlrs in February with the gains widespread through durable and nondurable industries , the department said .
Farmers ' incomes increased by 12 . 2 billion dlrs in February after declining by 8 . 7 billion dlrs in January .
Both last month ' s increase and January ' s fall in farm incomes was because of government subsidy payments , the department said .
Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5 . 5 billion dlrs in February following a 19 . 5 billion dlrs January drop .
The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 .
Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes .
Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up 1 . 2 pct or 37 . 8 billion dlrs to 3 , 063 . 4 billion dlrs after rising 25 . 8 billion dlrs in January .
The personal savings rate eased to 3 . 6 pct in February from four pct in January , the department said .

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986 / 87 PROFITS Deutsche Babcock AG & lt ; DBCG . F > expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory , managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said .
He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive .
Sales during the first five months to February was 1 . 26 billion marks , 46 . 7 pct down from the same 1985 / 86 period .
However , he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year ' s 5 . 14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked .
Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end - February totalled 2 . 50 billion marks compared with 2 . 04 billion for the same period in 1985 / 86 .
They included a 45 . 8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1 . 57 billion marks .
Orders in hand for the five months were 16 . 7 pct higher at 8 . 64 billion marks .
Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover .
In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5 . 14 billion against the previous year ' s 32 mln on 5 . 11 billion marks .
Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25 . 6 mln marks .
Wiehn said Babcock ' s liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year , with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985 / 86 .
He said pre - tax earnings per share for 1985 / 86 , according to the DVFA method , were 26 . 95 marks from 21 . 40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8 . 10 .

To carry grain , is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange ( BIFFEX ), dealers said .
Futures soared through the 1 , 000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985 .
However , the market tends to be nervous , with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index , which is calculated on spot physical rates .
No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage ( about 50 , 000 to 65 , 000 tonnes dw ) from the U . S . Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan , dealers said .
" It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its ( the Soviet ) grain harvest than reported ," one said .
Freight rates on the Gulf / Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions , with very few , if any , Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf .
Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month .
Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay - up to meet current demand .
Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year , they said .
They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract , despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year .
Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks .
Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices , which had supported the market at the start of the year , faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest .
DROUGHT MAY REDUCE ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT - GROWERS Zimbabwe ' s projected coffee output of 13 , 000 tonnes for 1987 / 88 could be reduced by drought , growers said .

SOVIET FIRM SAYS TALKS ON FOR PHILIPPINE MINE Preliminary talks are on between two state - owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp ( NMIC ) which operates the Philippines ' only nickel refinery , a Soviet official said .
G . I .
Valentchits , Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy , told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect .
" It is the other way round ," Valentchits said .
He said the Development Bank of the Philippines ( DBP ) and the Philippine National Bank ( PNB ), which own NMIC , had approached the Soviet state - owned firm in August last year .
" We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project ," Valentchits said .
He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were " only just initial .
" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment .
Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC , set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation .
The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure .
Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan , with Chemical Bank as the lead agent .
The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed by Citicorp .
It said the government ' s privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs , adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm .
The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15 . 8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors .
The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12 . 2 billion pesos , while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14 . 9 billion pesos .
NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm ' s financial difficulties .
The firm produced 1 , 863 tonnes of nickel in the first two months of 1986 , compared with 2 , 364 tonnes in the same period in 1985 .
The mine ' s capacity is 2 , 000 tonnes a month .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U . S . DEFICIT WITH NICs The U . S . trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year , despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries , economists said .
" The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U . S . in 1986 will get bigger .
This time next year , the U . S . will be screaming at those countries about their exports ," said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co . Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U . S . after Japan and Canada , while Korea is the seventh largest .
Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress , the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea , urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade .
The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries ( NICs ) amid signs the dollar ' s steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U . S . drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods .
U . S . Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan ' s trade surplus this year .
But U . S . manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea , whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark .
As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs , Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well - placed to take up the slack .
" In 1986 , the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan - bashing .
Now it ' s NIC - bashing ," said Robert Chandross , of Lloyds Bank PLC .
Asia ' s four main NICs -- Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one - fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U . S . merchandise trade deficit for 1986 .
The U . S . trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15 . 7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13 . 1 billion in 1985 , while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7 . 1 billion from 4 . 8 billion .
And preliminary U . S . data show that the growth trend is continuing .
The U . S . trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1 . 6 billion dlrs in January , up 24 . 4 pct from a year earlier .
The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs , up 24 . 8 pct from a year ago .
Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions .
Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U . S . wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation .
Still , South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44 . 5 billion dlr foreign debt .
For its part , Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1 , 700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports .
But vice economic minister Wang Chien - Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan ' s trade surplus with the U . S . will fall in 1987 .
The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods .
But Korea is raising its profile in the area of " big - ticket " manufactured goods , notably cars .
Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675 , 000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985 .
" The NICs ' exports are almost all manufactured goods .
When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U . S . manufacturing base .
It cuts directly to us and to our customers ," said Bob Wendt , manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp .
The U . S . takes 90 pct of Korea ' s computer products exports , 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment .
A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U . S .
While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U . S ., these are offset by their deficits with other countries .
But Taiwan and , to a lesser extent , South Korea , stand in marked contrast .
Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U . S . and major overrall trade and current account surpluses , the Morgan study says .
Morgan expects Taiwan ' s overall trade surplus to grow to 18 . 5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15 . 2 billion last year , and Korea ' s to increase to 6 . 5 billion dlrs from 3 . 5 billion .
Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U . S . " A lot of Korea and Taiwan ' s exports to the U . S . have been at Japan ' s expense ," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp . February ' s Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies .
But this two - pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and , in any case , will only work with a sizeable lag , economists say .
The U . S . has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan ' s and Korea ' s currencies should climb .
The Taiwan dollar , which is pegged to the U . S . dollar , has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct .
But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U . S . unit and the won has lost seven pct , economists say .
" We ' ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes ," said Bethlehem Steel ' s Wendt .
And so far , U . S . pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect .
Moreover , it is uncertain how far U . S . protectionism will get given the administration ' s free - trade stance .
" It ' s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year - end .
And then the question is , will it have teeth ?
" one economist said .

TALKING POINT / VIACOM INTERNATIONAL & lt ; VIA > A bidding war for Viacom International Inc , one of the largest U . S . entertainment companies , pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc , a closely held theater operator .
Both sides raised their bids over the weekend .
A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side .
He said if outside directors approve the management proposal , a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week .
" It would take 20 days from the day we mail ," said the source .
The source predicted National Amusements , controlled by investor Sumner Redstone , would need " half a year " to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom ' s broadcast licenses and cable television franchises .
Redstone was not available for comment .
Some of Wall Street ' s arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war .
One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan , he would have a chance to win .
The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today .
Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow .
Viacom shares climbed 2 - 1 / 2 to 50 - 3 / 8 by midafternoon .
One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation .
" We think we ' re at the end now , in terms of bidding ," said the firm ' s arbitrageur , who spoke on condition he not be identified .
Both Redstone ' s proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt .
The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2 . 5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock , convertible into 45 pct of the common stock .
Redstone ' s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash , a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7 . 50 dlrs , and one - fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings , representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom .
One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2 . 50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share .
Management offered 38 . 50 dlrs in cash , exchangeable preferred stock worth 8 . 50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred .
The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4 . 00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs .
Redstone ' s newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated .
The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter .
Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest .
Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group , led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes , were offering high prices .
" Redstone really wants to own the company ," one said .
Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue .
Redstone ' s company owns 19 . 6 pct ov Viacom ' s 35 mln shares .
A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth .
He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp & lt ; FMC >, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year , inititally traded at 12 . 50 dlrs per share , dipped to nine dlrs , and is now just over 30 dlrs .
Last week , Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts .
The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results .
Shares of Warner Communications Inc & lt ; WCI > rose 7 / 8 to 31 - 1 / 8 .
Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3 . 25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1 . 25 mln shares at 37 . 50 dlrs .
Chris Craft Industries & lt ; CCN >, which owns a stake in Warner , rose 1 - 1 / 4 to 22 - 3 / 4 .
Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc & lt ; CBS >.
The company has 940 , 000 cable television subscribers , operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations .
It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television .
COUNTRYWIDE CREDIT & lt ; CCR > SETS HIGHER DIVIDEND Countrywide Credit Industries Inc said its board declared an eight ct per share quarterly dividend , up from seven cts last quarter , and a two pct stock dividend .
The cash dividend is payable April 14 to holders of record March 30 and the stock dividend is payable April 17 to holders of record March 31 .
MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987 Madagascar ' s available coffee output is estimated at 80 , 725 tonnes this year , down from 82 , 210 in 1986 , due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas , Agriculture Ministry sources said .
This is after accounting for the loss of some 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside , they said .
The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987 , but they noted that shipments declined to 37 , 200 tonnes last year from 41 , 662 in 1985 .
Low yields from the country ' s ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance , the sources said .
They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar ' s coffee bushes were planted before 1930 .
The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110 , 000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63 , 000 tonnes outlined in the government ' s 1986 - 1990 five - year plan .
In order to reverse the decline in coffee production , the government has decided to plant 20 , 000 hectares with high - yielding arabica and canephora varieties , the sources said .
The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content .
The sources added that Madagascar ' s plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems .
Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year .

" Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400 , 000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs .
He said an increased depletion allowance , to 27 . 5 pct , on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production .
He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year .
Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool .
The White House said it would study the proposal , but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code , just passed last year .
Herrington , asked his reaction to the White House reaction , said , " If I were the White House , I would be cool , too .

USDA ASKS TIGHT INSECT RULES FOR GRAIN SHIPMENTS The U . S . Agriculture Department is proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on insect infestations in grain shipments .
The changes in the standards would include the following : -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live insects in shipments of food grains , feed grains and oilseeds .
-- Revising the definition of " infested " to give equal value to all insects injurious to grain .
-- Establishing lower levels of infestations .
In 1988 , the infested level would be set at three or more live insects per representative sample ( about 100 grams ), in 1990 two or more insects , and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set at one or more live insects per representative sample .
-- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a limit of 10 live or dead insects per sample .
-- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by adding a limit of 32 insect - damaged kernels per 100 grams of wheat .
The department asked for public comments on the proposals by April 17 .
PILLSBURY & lt ; PSY > HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS Pillsbury Corp , reporting lower earnings for the third quarter ended February 28 , said a strong performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group declines .
Excluding unusual items , it said restaurants operating profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales rose four pct .
It said Burger King USA and Bennigan ' s reported higher operating profit , but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale , which introduced a new menu .
Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron , Burger King ' s distribution arm , and said increased investment spending on developing concepts - QuikWok , Bay Street and Key West Grill - hurt results .
It said Foods operating profit , excluding unusual items , rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads and baking products major contributors to improvement in the quarter .
A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in profit improvement for the nine months , Pillsbury said .
Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4 . 3 mln dlr profit in the quarter reflecting a 10 . 5 mln dlr gain on the sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and lower corporate expenses , largely as a result of an early retirement program initiated a year ago .
Earlier , Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48 . 5 mln dlrs , or 56 cts a share , down from 55 . 4 mln dlrs , or 63 cts a share a year ago .
Sales advanced to 1 . 53 billion dlrs from 1 . 46 billion dlrs .
Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the 1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per - share earnings by nine cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months .
As a result of the act , it said its effective income tax rate rose eight points to 48 . 1 pct in the quarter and 5 . 5 percentage points to 49 . 7 pct for the nine months .

EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES European Community ( EC ) industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12 - country bloc into reasonable balance with demand .
The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22 , 000 jobs .
Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme , most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion , but did not go nearly far enough .
Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15 . 26 mln tonnes , provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs .
But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl - Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990 .
He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot - rolled wide - strip products , typically produced in plants employing thousands of people .
The sources said no minister challenged Narjes ' analysis that four or five hot - rolled wide - strip lines would have to close .
They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body , the Commission and representatives of member states .
However , diplomats said it was clear from today ' s discussions that such meetings will be difficult .
They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system , which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products , while talks on the closure plan proceed .
It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers .
German minister Martin Bangemann said his country ' s steel industry , the largest in the EC , should not suffer proportionately more than others , German sources said .
But British diplomats said their minister , Giles Shaw , insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account .
The state owned British Steel Corporation , benefitting from massive recent write - offs of its accumulated debts , is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black .
Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry .

BRITOIL SEES LOWER U . K . EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE Britoil Plc ' s & lt ; BTOL . L > exploration expenditure for the U . K .
In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986 , though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same , Chief executive David Walker said .
He told reporters following the release of the company ' s 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels .
U . K . Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln .
Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985 .
Earlier , Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985 , before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company ' s U . S . Assets .
The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night ' s close .
Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well .
Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained , the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year .
He added that the firmness of oil prices in March , when they were normally weaker , made him " a bit encouraged " about the prospects for future levels .
Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel .
Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April .
End - year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously .
However , Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves .
If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines , the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously .
Gas reserves also eased to 3 , 568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3 , 660 billion .
U . K . REVISES RETAIL PRICE INDEX FROM FEBRUARY The U . K . Government tomorrow will release the first of its Retail Price Index ( RPI ) figures calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on January 1987 , as previously announced , the Employment Department said .
The index , Britain ' s measure of inflation , is for February .
Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent figures including the new components , a spokesman said .
Previously , the RPI base was January , 1974 .
Market forecasts centre on a 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 pct monthly rise in February and a year on year rate about 4 . 0 pct .
The government forecasts annual inflation will be 4 . 0 pct at the end of 1987 .
TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE , GROUP SAYS Canada ' s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U . S . was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self - confidence , a public policy study group said " It suggests the Canada of the immediate post - war period , when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world ," the Washington - based Atlantic Council said .
U . S . and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries , the world ' s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually .
The council ' s study said the trade talks , with a deadline of October for an agreement , are the biggest issue in U . S .- Canadian relations .
The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties .
The council said " in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free - trade arrangement , fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population .
" But at the same time , it added , Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world .
The council said that in the talks , Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U . S . duties against allegedly subsidized exports .
A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U . S . imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized .
The council said the chief U . S . concerns included ending curbs against U . S . banking , insurance , telecommunications , and the so - called " cultural industries " - publishing , broadcasting and films .
It said other major U . S .- Canadian issues were defense cooperation , " acid rain " and the U . S . rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage .

PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end - September 1988 , despite last October ' s landslide which dumped 0 . 5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway , Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said .
He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission ' s earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988 , he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989 .
The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year ' s revenues .
This year ' s deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs , McAuliffe said .
This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth - moving operations to prevent any further landslides .
He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal ' s water supply in the foreseeable future .
Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide , he said , adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest .

FRENCH FEBRUARY OFFICIAL RESERVES RISE French official reserves rose 12 . 73 billion francs to 388 . 68 billion francs at the end of February from 375 . 95 billion at the end of January , the Finance Ministry said .
It said in a statement the rise was mainly due to inflows of foreign currency through the exchange stabilisation fund , which resulted in an increase of 12 . 41 billion francs .
Reserves of European Currency Units rose by 25 mln francs to 73 . 27 billion francs , due to interest adjustments , while gold reserves rose by two mln francs to 218 . 46 billion francs .
FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH French gross domestic product will grow by only 1 . 5 pct in real terms this year , compared with the government ' s forecast of two to 2 . 5 pct growth , the private Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le Developpement des Entreprises ( IPECODE ) said .
However , it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct .
IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year , in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand , unleashing higher import demand .
Claims on the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) rose by 298 mln francs to 19 . 61 billion francs , due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations , and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) due mainly to the repayment of French debts .
Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund ( FECOM ) remained unchanged in February at 33 . 90 billion francs .
French household consumption , which rose by 3 . 1 pct last year , is likely to grow by just 1 . 1 pct this year and 1 . 5 pct in 1988 , it added .
Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4 . 3 pct this year and 5 . 5 pct in 1988 , down from 6 . 5 pct in 1986 .
Inflation , which was running at 2 . 1 pct at the end of 1986 , is likely to rise to 2 . 9 pct at the end of this year , IPECODE said , while the government has forecast 2 . 5 pct .
However , the institute said inflation would fall back to 2 . 5 pct at the end of 1988 , " provided that real wage costs remain within the framework of productivity rises .

SOLAR SYSTEMS & lt ; SSDN >, INKEY OF SPAIN SET PACT Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain .
It said a spermicide used in INKEY ' s condoms contains an ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of AIDS .
The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German publication , Aids Forschung .
But it said the article was about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the condoms made by INKEY .
The company also said it is changing its name to Eurocapital Corp shortly .
Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a U . S .- based & lt ; Europharmaceutical Co >.
INKEY and an affiliate own the remaining shares of the company , which was set up to distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made , or are being developed by INKEY .
The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for the distributorship .
The first 500 , 000 dlr payment is due 30 days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file with the FDA to market the condom , but expects the approval process to be a lengthy one .
The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is currently used in the U . S . in antiseptic applications unrelated to condoms .
As far as it knows , the ingredient has not been tested in a spermicide .
Inkey ' s condoms will be sold in the U . S . under the brand name , " Carlton .
" The exclusive distribution contract for the products runs for three years and is renewable for one - year periods , the company said .
It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have not gone on sale in other European countries .
It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from the FDA .
The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little or no assets .
In the event an acquisition goes through , Solar Systems ' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below its current 45 pct .

KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES Owners of two aluminum smelters in Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate hike to ( Big Rivers Electric Corp ) of Henderson , Ky .
But the owners of the smelters , ( National Southwire Aluminum Co ) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd & lt ; AL >, said further viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the rate case is eventually settled .
" We ' re hoping for no rate increases but we can ' t say for sure .
It ' s still possible we ' ll have to close the smelter ," a National Southwire spokesman said .
He said there were other variables to consider in any decision whether to close or continue the smelter , located in Hawesville , about 60 miles west of Louisville .
National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc & lt ; NII >, which holds about 55 pct , and ( Southwire Co ), which holds the rest , the spokesman said .
A spokesman for Montreal - based Alcan said , " The decision is 48 pages long and is in legal - ese , so it certainly will be a long time before we can make a decision " about what it means for the Sebree smelter in Henderson , about 100 miles west of Louisville .
" But we ' re delighted that Big Rivers Electric was denied the requested rate increase .
" A spokesman for the utility , a cooperative that generates and wholesales electricity to four distributors , said the requested increase was 7 . 5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates .
The Kentucky Public Service Commission , in denying the increase , asked the utility to meet with creditors , which include Manufacturers Hanover Corp & lt ; MHC > and Irving Bank Corp & lt ; V >, and the smelters , to renegotiate a rate plan , the utility spokesman said .
The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index their electric costs to the price of aluminum , he said .
" We have always been amenable to try , as far as we can , to assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable ," he said .
No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned between the utility , its creditors and the aluminum plant owners .
The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for July 28 .

API SAYS U . S . CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO The American Petroleum Institute said that U . S . crude oil production in February declined 9 . 8 pct from year - ago levels to about 8 . 3 mln barrels a day .
In its monthly report on U . S . oil supplies and stocks , API said that domestic demand for petroleum products , as measured by products supplied , continued to rise reaching 16 . 3 mln barrels a day in the month , up 1 . 5 pct from February 1986 .
API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production , which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels , represented a decline in U . S . production of more than one mln barrels a day .
API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February , a 30 . 3 pct increase from last year ' s level .
So far this year , API said growth in domestic demand , which was up 2 . 9 pct from last year ' s year - to - date level , has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986 .
It said crude oil production for the first two months of 1987 was off 8 . 6 pct from the comparable year - ago period while crude imports were up 30 . 6 pct .

ICI & lt ; ICI > SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES Imperial Chemical Industries PLC , the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom , will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year , and better its 1986 results , said chairman - elect Denys Henderson .
" We expect to shift our company toward higher value - added businesses and continue to broaden our base ," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here .
ICI today announced the formation of a new U . S . drug company , ICI Pharma , which , with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit , it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1 . 1 billion dlrs by 1990 .
Henderson said , " Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo ' s ( Glaxo Holdings PLC ) does not .
" ICI ' s pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U . K . Last year U . S . drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1 . 5 billion dlrs , which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits .
He estimated that by 1990 , ICI ' s pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits .
" The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return ," said A . W .
Clements , finance director of ICI , who was also at the meeting .
Henderson said the new U . S . drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors .
ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one .
Henderson said the major new products in the company ' s pipeline , expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually , were Statil , a treatment for diabetic complications , Zoladex , a treatment for advanced prostate cancer , and Carwin , a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure .
Henderson said U . S . Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex , both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc & lt ; MRK >, is not expected until about 1989 .
ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U . S . later this year .
Henderson said the company ' s 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5 . 45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs , but he declined to specify by how much .
Henderson said 1987 ' s results would be boosted by Glidden Paints , which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc . Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions .
Last year the company made 40 acquisitions , the largest being Glidden .
He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as " too expensive .
" Henderson said that in his new role of chairman , effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey - Jones who will retire , the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses .

NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) will be formally adopted tomorrow , chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said .
" The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation ," he told a news conference .
The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October .
Delegates at the renegotiation conference , held under the auspices of the U . N . Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ), reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend .
Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 201 . 66 Malaysian / Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact .
Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian / Singapore currency , he added .
The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the " may sell " and " may buy " points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price , as well as the " must sell " and " must buy " zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it .
Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord .
" The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply ," he said .
The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550 , 000 tonnes , Xuto added .
At this month ' s session , which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA , the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price .
It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18 - month intervals .
The extent of the adjustment was also modified .
Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention (" may sell ") price ( currently 231 Malaysian / Singapore cents ) or below the lower intervention price (" may buy ") price ( 171 cents at present ) for six months , the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides .
Under the new pact , the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment .
Similarly , when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300 , 000 tonnes , there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage .
Throughout the talks , which began on March 9 , producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the " lower indicative price " ( or floor price ) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , reached 450 , 000 tonnes .
The proposal , initiated by the U . S ., was withdrawn last Friday , setting the stage for compromise at the weekend .
Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact .
On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA , Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational .
The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct .
INVESTMENT GROUP HAS MOORE - HANDLEY & lt ; MHCO > STAKE A group of New York investment companies told the Securities and Exchange Commission they have acquired 173 , 000 shares of Moore - Handley Inc , or 6 . 9 pct of the total outstanding common stock .
The firms , Robert H . Barker and Co , J . M . R .

But the group said it might buy more Moore - Handley shares .
EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community , broker C . Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review .
The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0 . 01 European Currency Unit ( Ecu ) to the intervention price , with detrimental consequences for producers ' returns , Czarnikow says .
The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar .
The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course , such as removing the time limit on storage contracts , which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September , Czarnikow says .
There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced .
If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export , the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders , Czarnikow notes .
To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price , the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne , it says .
The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy , Czarnikow says , but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules .
The primary cause of the plan to sell 775 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price , Czarnikow notes .
The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission ' s hand .
In West Germany , 79 , 250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention , but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986 / 87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986 .
In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price , West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the " green " mark .
Even if the immediate crisis is resolved , the problem is not expected to disappear permanently .
It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC ' s export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand , it says .
The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded , Czarnikow says , suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of " unnecessary bureaucracy " surrounding the export tender system .

GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being .
It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest - straining factors in the economy that could affect the long - term capital market .
The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates .
But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year ' s end and next year , it said .
The association said generally low interest rates , prospects of lower taxes , a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth .
The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short - term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long - term capital market , which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy , it said .
In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer - term capital market , the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short - term and expansionist monetary policy .
On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987 .
The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short - term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments .
The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions , it said .
ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK DETAILS TOMORROW The International Cocoa Council , ICCO , adjourned for the day after a detailed proposal on buffer stock rules was distributed and executive committee officials were elected , delegates said .
Producers , EC consumers and all consumers are scheduled to hold separate meetings tomorrow to review the proposal , written by ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn , they said .
The buffer stock working group is to meet again on rules Monday morning , and the full council is to reconvene Tuesday , delegates said .
Heinz Hofer of Switzerland was elected executive committee chairman and Mette Mogstad of Norway vice chairman , they added .
FED ' S JOHNSON URGES STRONGER ALLIED GROWTH Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that the U . S .' s main industrial partners should expand their domestic growth .
In a speech to a women ' s group here , Johnson said , " There is room for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strong enough to absorb growth in U . S . export markets .
" Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange rates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies has brought western nations a long way towards establishing that goal .
Johnson said , " The Fed supports this pattern of exchange rates ... and we ' ll see if it leads to a convergence in trade .
Quite possibly it can be achieved .
" Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the major surplus countries .
He said this was " a major improvement and a step in the right direction " and added U . S . allies look very strongly to a U . S . budget deficit cut .
" There will always be a potential risk of breakdown in international cooperation " without a budget deficit cut .
U . K . MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT , ANALYSTS SAY Slower than expected growth in Britain ' s narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U . K . Interest rates if a surge in sterling ' s value requires such a move , economic analysts said .
M0 , the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday , fell an adjusted 3 / 4 to one pct in February .
On an annual basis , this put M0 growth at four to 4 - 1 / 2 pct , in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct .
" The M0 data are much better than we expected ," said Robert Thomas , economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities .
He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut , they removed an obstacle to such a move .
Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February , advancing an adjusted 2 . 2 pct after a fall of the same size in January .
Analysts said the M0 measure , reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects , was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates .
" The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ...
In practice , it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune ," Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment .
Richard Jeffrey , economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett , said in a comment : " It is unlikely that ( Lawson ) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken .
" " With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable , the City has been forced to take it seriously ," he added .
Noting this point , Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared .
This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U . K . Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets , analysts said .
Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month , they added .
U . K . Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement , once on March 11 , and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget .
They stand at 10 pct now , and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half - point in the coming week .
Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3 , which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct , well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct .
Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed , but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31 .
Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target , and Lawson ' s move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy .
FED ' S JOHNSON SEES INFLATION CONTROLLED Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said inflationary pressures are under control and noted " wage and price pressures are very moderate .
" Johnson told a women ' s group that the U . S . was not seeing the kind of cost pressures of the past .
He said the trade imbalance was a serious trouble spot and strong protectionist pressures , if translated into policies , could ultimately lead to higher inflation and a high interest rate policy by the Fed .

MARK IV SAYS IT DOES NOT PLAN BAIRD & lt ; BATM > BUY Mark IV Industries Inc & lt ; IV >, which has said it is mulling a bid to seek control of Baird Corp , said it has no present plans to acquire more than 25 pct of the company ' s total outstanding common stock .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mark IV said its top officials told Baird executives at a March 17 meeting that while Mark IV may buy more Baird common stock , it presently intends to hold it to the 25 pct limit .
Mark IV , which first disclosed its stake and interest in Baird on March 10 , has reported it holds 391 , 800 Baird common shares , or 17 . 6 pct of the total outstanding .
Mark IV said it also agreed at the meeting that if it decides to seek control of Baird , it would be through a negotiated merger or business combination or through a tender offer in which Baird would have at least 24 hours notice .
Baird , in turn , agreed not to take any defensive measures without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice , it said .
Baird also confirmed that a takeover defense plan it already has which is triggered by the accumulation of more than 25 pct of its stock , would not be triggered by a tender offer , Mark IV said .
Both parties also agreed to adjourn pending litigation they have against one another , it added .

EC MINISTERS ANNOUNCE PLAN FOR STEEL CLOSURES European Community ( EC ) industry ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures , drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer , and calculated to lead to the loss of about 22 , 000 jobs .
The ministers resolved that the proposed closures , which should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand , " remain considerably below the surplus in capacity .
" They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with Eurofer , major steel companies and with governments , to pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the annual 15 . 26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer .
The Commission will draw up a new system of steel production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full rigors of open competition .
Commission sources said any new system would cover only heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market , instead of 65 pct under the present system .
Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet again in Brussels on June 1 , the sources said .
Industry Commissioner Karl - Heinz Narjes told ministers capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990 .
U . S .
GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U . S . agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U . S . prices to be at world market levels , U . S . grain trade industry officials said .
They said that Shultz ' s comments , while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR , were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action .
In response to a query on what the State Department ' s position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow , Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U . S . is going to trade .
The Soviet Union , the world ' s largest grain importer , has bought no U . S . wheat for more than a year , complaining the price was far above world market levels .
A U . S . offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower - priced wheat through the export enhancement program , EEP , was also rebuffed due to the price .
Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U . S . wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union , grain industry sources said .
Intense speculation the U . S . might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions .
Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2 - 1 / 4 cents by midday at 2 . 88 - 1 / 4 dlrs per bushel , while CBT March wheat was up 1 - 1 / 2 cents at 2 . 92 - 1 / 2 dlrs .
" I ' m not sure this is an about - face , but it ' s clearly a recognition that unless we ' re competitive , we won ' t sell to the Soviet Union ," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group .
" We have to be competitive .
It ' s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else ," Shultz told the farm leaders .
" That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets ," he said .
If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U . S . selling wheat to the USSR under EEP , it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow , an industry lobbyst said .
National Wheat Grower ' s officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary ' s comments .
" His comments were not discouraging , but they didn ' t in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP ," an official with the wheat group said .
The Wheat Growers official noted , however , that " there is significance in that fact that we haven ' t seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets .
" In a meeting with exporters this week , Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , the officials said .
An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets , said that the Shultz comments " are consistent with what he ( Shultz ) has taught for years as an economist ," but said they don ' t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union .
Amstutz could not be reached for comment , and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz ' s statements .
But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow .
" If he didn ' t say no , then there ' s a chance .
This is potentially a positive development ," a commodity source said .

EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize , Commission sources said .
They said the tax , which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non - EC countries alike , would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia .
The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority ' s cereals management committee today .
The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries .
The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them .
The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450 , 000 tonnes of maize .
The request will be considered at the committee ' s next meeting , the commission sources said .
Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1 . 7 mln tonnes of maize this year , while an EC - U . S . accord guarantees non - EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300 , 000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years .
