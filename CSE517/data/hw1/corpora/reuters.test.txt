UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The " cross field allowance " relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ) announced by U . K . Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non - PRT paying fields , according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co .
The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields .
It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval .
A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size , the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field .
" The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability ," the report said , adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced .
The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7 . 5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax , the report said .
On fields likely to pay PRT in the future , the benefit is of timing .
Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately , liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets , it said .
In a study on probable fields , the report said that when the rates of return are examined , the rise for a PRT - paying field such as Miller , the largest undeveloped oil field in the U . K . North Sea , is from 18 . 7 to 19 pct , while the rise for a small non - PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15 . 9 to 17 . 9 pct .
The report added that in fields which pay PRT , there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief .
Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field ' s future profits , but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost .
Thus , a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time .
CONGRESSMEN URGE U . S .
SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES Several leading farm - state Congressmen said they will press the U . S . Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income .
Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing , chairman Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks .
" Let ' s see if we can try to push them ( USDA ) to do something without legislation ," Glickman told the hearing .
The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection , or marketing loan .
David Haggard , American Soybean Association , ASA , president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program .
The current soybean program " gave us the worst of both worlds ," ASA ' s Haggard told the hearing .
The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America , he said .
At the same time , the U . S . soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers , Haggard said .
" We need some kind of market loan ," he added .
The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority .
Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA , but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan .
USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a " dilemna " which has been studied extensively by the department .
But he did not say what , if any changes , are under consideration .
In his testimony , Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers , such as a so - called producer option payment , or a direct payment program .
Haggard said barring any program changes , Commodity Credit Corporation , CCC , soybean stocks , now at 385 mln bu , will rise to 500 mln by the end of August .
A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end - year .
" Thus , CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil ' s entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987 ," Haggard said .
However , Haggard said that the U . S . should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U . S . program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , GATT .
He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U . S . soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating .
The Reagan administration has given " mixed signals " on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC , Haggard said .
While the ASA position is to support a 5 . 02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan , Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep . Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan .
The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee , Rep . Edward Madigan of Illinois .
Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans , but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs .
Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget .
Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan , the U . S . soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially .
This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs .
But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered .
RAISE IN BRAZIL FCOJ EXPORT PRICES NOT CONFIRMED There is no confirmation that Brazil ' s major processors of Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice , FCOJ , will raise export prices of the product to 1 , 375 dlrs per tonne from April 1 , a spokesman for the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries ( Abrassuco ) said .
Asked to comment on a report from New York that Cutrale and Citrosuco had sent telexes to customers informing of the price raise , Jose Carlos Goncalves said Abrassuco was not aware of it .
" All we know is that Cacex has increased the dollar amount to translate FOB price to ex - dock New York price to 1 , 050 dlrs from 770 dlrs ," Goncalves said .
Citrosuco and Cutrale officials were not available for comment .

TEXAS COMMERCE & lt ; TCB > SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank ' s planned merger with Chemical New York Corp & lt ; CHL > would help 1987 earnings increase from last year ' s profits of 20 mln dlrs .
Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love , in an interview with Reuters , did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase .
" We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger ," Love said , referring to Texas Commerce ' s pending 1 . 19 billion dlr merger with Chemical .
The merger , which may be finalized as early as May 1 , will lower Texas Commerce ' s cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points , Love said .
The Texas Commerce - Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out - of - state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1 .
Hard - hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas ' struggling economy , the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54 . 0 mln dlrs .
Allied Bancshares Inc & lt ; ALBN > lost 17 . 6 mln dlrs , MCorp & lt ; M > lost 82 . 1 mln dlrs , InterFirst lost 326 . 5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation & lt ; FBT >, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital , lost 402 . 0 mln dlrs .
Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems , but added that the bank ' s nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987 .
" I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us ," he said .
" The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans .
" In 1986 , about 42 pct of Texas Commerce ' s net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses .
That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank ' s losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct .
More than half of Texas Commerce ' s nonperforming loans , which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986 , up from 840 mln dlrs the year before , were in real estate .
Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987 .
Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston , which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct , will be a gradual process that could take up to four years , he said .
" I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy .
Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel ," he said .
Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas , offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business , Love said .
" We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position ," he said .
In January , Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County , adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area , and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio .
Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas - Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks , he said .
One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December , InterFirst Corp & lt ; IFC > and RepublicBank Corp & lt ; RPT >, both headquartered in Dallas , agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs .
The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst , giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market , has not changed Texas Commerce ' s expansion plans for the state ' s second - largest city , Love said .
" We think we can try to get a little part of their roost ," he said .
The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products , he said .
" We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state .
Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products ," he said , referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking .
CSCE PUTS ADDITIONAL MARGIN ON JULY COFFEE An additional margin of 1 , 000 dlrs will be required on all July 1987 delivery coffee " C " contracts as of the opening of trade Monday , March 23 , the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , CSCE , said .
The March contract ends trading this week , making May and July the two " spot ," or unlimited , contract months next week .
Members will then have to obtain a minimum 3 , 500 dlrs for net long or net short positions in the May and July contracts , including a 2 , 500 original margin plus the additional 1 , 000 dlr spot charge .

SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN , EUROPE Beryl Sprinkel , chairman of the president ' s council of economic advisors , said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U . S . exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines .
" Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U . S . export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation ," he told the Futures Industry Association .
Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post - war period .
" Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery ," he said .
Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners , he said recent figures showed Japan ' s economy grew by about 0 . 5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 , " Not enough to sustain employment growth .
" However , Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies , including tax reform .
" I suspect there will be further moves ," he said .
Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U . S . government spending and for resistance to tax increases .
" Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform ," he said , adding that " a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform .
" Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U . S . cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U . S . trade balance appeared to have abated .
However , he said that " sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable ," as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad .
" I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 ," he said .
Improvements in the U . S . trade balance , he said , will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present " serious adjustment problems for U . S . trading partners .
" Western Europe , where manufactures output and employment have been weak , promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U . S . trade balance , Sprinkel said .
He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them .
BROWN TRANSPORT & lt ; BTCI > SEES RECORD 1987 NET Brown Transport Co said it expects to report record 1987 results with revenues increasing to 214 mln dlrs and earnings per share between 1 . 25 dlrs and 1 . 30 dlrs .

TALKING POINT / AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > American Express Co ' s plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit , analysts said .
American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs .
The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks , as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U . S . brokerage industry by Japanese concerns .
The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U . S . firm .
Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2 . 7 times book value .
Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks , depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U . S . insider trading scandal , closed out February at a market value of 1 . 8 times book value .
American Express was trading today at 78 - 1 / 4 , off 3 / 8 .
For the last several weeks , the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson .
Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets .
" I think this , in all honesty , is a preliminary step ," said Long .
" What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson ," Long said .
" Normally , investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation ," he said of Nippon .
Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public .
They said the firm , like other investment banks , needs capital to expand globally .
American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally .
However , that number is substantially lower than growth last year , a company spokesman said .
American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning .
That statement , however , did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson .
David Anthony , a Smith Barney analyst , said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public .
But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first .
" I think they ' ll figure out what they ' re going to do with the money they have ," he said .
Joan Goodman , an analyst with Pershing and Co , also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public .
In its statement , the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon .
American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson ' s capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital .
American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express ' worldwide financial services strategy .
Shearson follows Goldman , Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner .
Goldman last year sold a 12 . 5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion .
Analysts speculated there will be more such matches .
" Those ( U . S . brokers ) companies have the expertise .
They don ' t have the money .
There ' s just not enough internal capital growth ," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury , who follows other U . S . brokerage companies .
Hanbury said some Japanese companies , flush with cash , are interested in the expertise of American brokers .
" Those ( Japanese ) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money .
That ' s a nice marriage ," he said .

ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION Liberalization of Italy ' s foreign exchange controls should be " gradual " but also " reasonably rapid ," a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said .
The report , looking at the country ' s financial development prospects , said Italy ' s large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable .
The report also favoured retention of the lira ' s six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System ( EMS ) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short - term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments .
The lira ' s fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies .
Italy has over recent months announced a series of deregulation moves in response to a European Community directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods , services and finance by 1992 .
USDA REPORTS CORN SOLD TO USSR , TAIWAN The U . S . Agriculture Department said private U . S . exporters reported new sales of 900 , 000 tonnes of corn to the Soviet Union and 350 , 000 tonnes of corn switched from previously announced unknown destinations to the USSR .

The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143 , 000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan , with 56 , 000 tonnes for shipment in the 1986 / 87 season and the balance for shipment in the 1987 / 88 year .
The marketing year for corn began September 1 .

Proved reserves of liquids remained about the same at 25 . 1 mln barrels , the company said in the 1986 annual just released by Transco Energy Co & lt ; E >, the majority owner of the Transco Exploration partnership .
Transco said that anticipated oil and gas prices during 1987 would continue to exert pressure on the profitability of most energy companies .
The Transco pipeline system reached permanent take - or - pay settlements on about half its committed gas deliverability and interim agreements for another 38 pct of its deliverability , the annual report said .
The company said it paid a total of about 363 mln dlrs to producers through Februry one out of its 550 mln dlr reserve to settle the take - or - pay disputes .
Transco said its gas pipeline delivered more than 1 . 2 trillion cubic feet last year and its marketing affiliate sold an average of 1 . 6 billion cubic feet of gas per day .
The company ' s exploration partnership received an average price of 1 . 84 dlrs per mln cubic feet for gas sales during 1986 , down from 3 . 04 dlrs in 1985 .

U . S .
WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed , two U . S . wheat organizations said .
The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions , " but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions " on world grain trade , the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers , NAWG , and the chairman of U . S .
Wheat Associates said in a letter to U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter .
Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government - run export trading entities , a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved , and a recognition that supply reductions by the U . S . have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be , the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments .
Australia ' s proposals , which aim to reduce U . S . target prices and " quarantine " U . S . wheat stocks , would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U . S . farmers , they said .
Other countries , including Australia , have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U . S . acreage and crop reduction programs , the organizations said .
" We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers ," Jim Miller , president of NAWG said .
" We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world ' s major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture ," Miller said .

AMOCO & lt ; AN > OIL RESERVES DOWN , GAS UP IN 1986 Amoco Corp ' s petroleum liquids reserves total 2 . 42 billion barrels at the end of 1986 , down from 2 . 77 billion a year earlier , but its natural gas reserves increased to 15 . 37 trillion cubic feet from 15 . 14 trillion , the company ' s annual report said .
It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year .
This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels , with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States , the report said .
Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year , while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves .
Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains , the report said .
All of the gas reserve purchases , as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986 , were in the United States , Amoco said , noting it has spent 1 . 1 billion dlrs to acquire U . S . producing properties over the past three years .
Commenting on 1987 , Amoco said acquisitions " will be an integral part of our strategy , should reserves become available at attractive prices .
" The company said it expects " the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987 , which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales .
As prices and demand improve , we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities .
" Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3 . 2 billion dlrs .
Such spending totaled 3 . 18 billion dlrs last year , down from 5 . 31 billion in 1985 .
QUEBEC CAISSE EARNS THREE BILLION DLRS IN 1986 Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec , the government agency which manages the province ' s pension funds , said its investment portfolio earned a net profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986 , an increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985 .
The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs , or a market value of 28 billion dlrs , at the end of 1986 .
These holdings had a rate of return of 13 . 5 pct in the year , which was below the Caisse ' s average return of 16 pct in the past four years and 14 . 2 pct in the past eight years .
The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3 . 6 pct of total assets , while U . S . government securities accounted for another 5 . 2 pct of the overall portfolio .
The agency ' s holding of U . S . government securities yielded a return of 20 . 7 pct for the year , significantly more than either the 14 . 1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the 13 . 5 pct for all funds under management .
" These high liquidity securities , which are held on a temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection of the overall bond portfolio , have been efficient ," the agency said of the U . S . securities .
The agency said it has 7 . 9 billion dlrs invested in Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986 .
The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other Quebec government issuers during the year .

ASEA GROUP & lt ; ASEAY > SEES FLAT 1987 EARNINGS Asea Group , the diversified industrial concern based in Vasteras , Sweden , said it expects 1987 earnings , after financial income and expense , to be flat compared with 1986 , when it earned 2 . 53 billion Swedish crowns , or 371 . 1 mln dlrs .
A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear power plants .
This gain , he said , will be balanced in 1987 by a return to profitability by Asea ' s power transmission segment , which had a loss of 183 mln crowns , or 26 . 9 mln dlrs , last year .
Currency conversions were made at 6 . 81 crowns to the dlr .
The spokesman said the company has built up a strong backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and beyond .
At yearend 1986 , Asea ' s order backlog stood at 32 . 7 billion crowns , or 4 . 8 billion dlrs , up from 30 . 9 billion , or 4 . 5 billion dlrs , at the end of 1985 .
Asea has operations in power generation and transmission , transportation equipment , pollution control and robotics .
Total sales in 1986 were 46 billion crowns , or 6 . 8 billion dlrs .
U . S . BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 228 MLN DLRS U . S . bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18 , the Federal Reserve said .
Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs , with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs .
The week was the first half of a two - week statement period .
Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs .
Commenting on the two - week statement period that ended on March 11 , the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported .
A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed ' s reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period .
None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday borrowing was made by the smallest banks .
For the week as a whole , the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large regionals and the small banks .
Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday -- for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason -- to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday .
The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of transportation float in mid - and south - Atlantic states .
Noting that the weather was " basically good " for March , the spokesman said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a day for the full week .
Float related as - ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error corrections in five districts .
As - ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday .

For the year ended July 31 , 1986 , Gelco reported pre - tax operating earnings of 14 . 8 mln dlrs , or 1 . 08 dlrs a share .
However , final results will be affected by certain charges including legal and investment advisors fees , preferred stock dividends and other costs of restructuring , it said .

The final outcome for the fiscal year will be determined by the timing and proceeds from the sale , it added .

SEA CONTAINERS & lt ; SCR > EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR Sea Containers Ltd predicted its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10 mln dlrs over the same period a year ago .
The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than fiscal 1986 , from which the company recorded a loss of 67 . 6 mln dlrs , or 6 . 28 dlrs per share , on revenues of 641 . 4 mln dlrs .
James Sherwood , president of the company , said he expects to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first quarter , compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for first quarter fiscal 1986 .
The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally slow period for the ferry industry , which is part of Sea Containers ' business .
Sherwoood said the company ' s losses were largely attributable to non - recurring events and provisions .
He cited the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers , costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs .
He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary ' s ferry services , and a 10 . 3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs .
FIRST INTERSTATE & lt ; I > ESTIMATES BRAZIL RISKS First Interstate Bancorp said its 1987 pre - tax income could be reduced by about 33 . 5 mln dlrs if it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium - to long - term loans to Brazil as nonperforming .
But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to reclassify the debt , despite Brazil ' s Feb 20 suspension of direct interest payments on medium - and long - term loans .
" The corporation believes that it is premature to make a decsion to classify such medium - and long - term debt as nonperforming at this time ," First Interstate said .
But First Interstate said that if Brazil ' s suspension of interest payments continues , it may have to reclassify its loans as nonperforming and place them on non - accrual , meaning that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted from net income and interest would no longer be accrued .
Besides its medium - and long - term debt , First Interstate said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short - term loans or trade lines in Brazil .
As of Dec 31 , 1986 , nonperforming Brazilian outstandings were about 4 . 1 mln dlrs , it said .

SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U . S . wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department , a State Department official said .
" Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer , and he ' s not going to the mat again .
It ' s now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do ," the official said .
If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union , he said , " Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it .
He might not come out in favor of it , but he won ' t go to the President and voice his objections .
" In an official statement clarifying Shultz ' s remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers , the State Department said , " Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible , U . S . grain should be competitive on world markets , including the Soviet Union .
The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program .
" Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets , there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow , the State Department official said .
" Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered , we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy .
" USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat , the official , who asked not to be identified , said .
The Soviets rejected the U . S . offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U . S . prices down to competitive levels .
The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time , the State Department source said .
" What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world ," he said .
The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U . S . and that they are entitled to the best price , he said .
Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA , most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets .
" Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion ," the State Department official said .

EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U . S . TRADE BILL Sir Roy Denman , Head of the EC Delegation in Washington , said pending U . S . trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation ' s trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form .
" To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake ," he told the Foreign Trade Association here .
Denman told reporters that possible retaliation , which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski , would not necessarily be on a product - for - product basis .
" Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product ," Denman said .
He said in the case of textiles import restrictions , however , retaliation would be against U . S . textile exports .
" Certainly , if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U . S ., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U . S . textile exports to Europe ," Denman said .
He also took exception to U . S . proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U . S . to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs .
" This would conflict with international obligations , throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang ," he warned of the tariff proposals .
Denman also took exception to U . S . efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors .
" Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party ," he said , adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another .
PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI & lt ; AMI > BID Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company .
Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened , 1 . 91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders , including the biggest investor , the Bass family of Texas .
However , the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer , he said .
Pesch , in an interview with Reuters , said based on the conversations he held with shareholders , he could not guage whether he had majority support .
He said , however , there is support for his offer .
Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc , the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock .
Earlier today , Wedge Group , which has a 5 . 5 pct stake , said it held discussions with Pesch , American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders .
Wedge , in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be " highly desirable and appropriate at this time .
" " That ' s the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share ," said Pesch .
Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort , in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash , four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share .
Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical , but it would not rule out a future takeover try .
Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family .
Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch ' s takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical ' s previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch .
American Medical is expected to resist Pesch ' s latest bid .
Larry Feinberg , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management - led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out .
An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10 .
Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical .
The Bass family holds an 11 .
6 pct stake in American Medical , and the company has previously said the investors support management ' s internal plan to improve the company ' s performance .
The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch .
Pesch , who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year , continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition .
Republic also has substantial debt , and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal .
Pesch ' s first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm , another cause for concern to Wall Street .
However , Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson , Lufkin , and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group .
" I don ' t have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed , provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment ," Pesch said .
Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made .
He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place .
He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals .
Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical .
Byron Nimocks of E . F . Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share .
Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts , compared to a 95 ct loss last year .
Nimocks said Pesch ' s revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously .
But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer .
" I think it ' s much more doable ," he said .
Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs .

ECUADOR GETS LOAN TO HELP REPAIR OIL PIPELINE The Andean Development Corp ( CAF ) said today it is lending 11 . 7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month .
the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation ' s president , galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil .
the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline , but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction .
Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage , and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50 , 000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired .
The OPEC member has a production quota of 210 , 000 bpd but has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310 , 000 bpd once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss .

FED DATA SUGGEST U . S . CREDIT POLICY IS ON HOLD Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U . S . banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold , economists said .
" There is ample liquidity ....
The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month ," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . " Technical and seasonal considerations aside , there is nothing for the ( credit ) market to get excited about ," added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc .
Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed ' s discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday , compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods .
Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks ' net free reserves in the two - week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln .
Finally , a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed ' s discount window for the third week running , with the latest week ' s borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks .
While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period , economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks .
The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements .
" Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure ," said Salomon ' s di Clemente , noting the approaching month - and quarter - end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April .
" The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement ," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc , who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April .
Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth , not only in the largely discredited M - 1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M - 2 and M - 3 aggregates .
M - 1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine , compared with private forecasts of a 2 . 3 mln dlr rise .
Weekly M - 2 and M - 3 components also hinted at slower overall growth .
" The M - 1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M - 2 and M - 3 figures for March ," said Salomon ' s di Clemente .
Merrill ' s McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges .
In February , M - 2 was 18 . 2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M - 3 was 20 . 8 billion beneath .
Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson ' s encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas , some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here .
" Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else ," said Salomon ' s di Clemente , adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U . S . economy .
Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy ' s health would remain the main influence on policy but , contrary to di Clemente , he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first .
Drexel ' s Ramirez did not commit herself either way , adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February ' s U . S . trade data are due for release .
ICO EXPORTERS TO MODIFY NEW PROPOSAL International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow , ICO delegates said .

The proposed share - out would still include shortfall declarations , they said .
U . S . SAYS NO SIGNAL BEING SENT BY SHIP MOVEMENTS A U . S . Navy battle group led by the U . S . aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Sea amid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coast of Iran , U . S . officials said today .
But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports the naval strike force was in the region did not mean the United States was sending a new warning to Iran against escalating attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf .
" Nothing like that has happened ," he said .
" No signal is being sent .
" He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area where it usually does .
" It ' s normal .
It ' s in the waters where it ' s supposed to be .
It ' s been there for over a month .
" The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay of the U . S . Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea .
With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the south and the U . S . Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to the north , the United States has 10 warships on either end of the strategic Straits of Hormuz .
The Pentagon , as is its custom , declined to confirm the exact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to .
State Department officials cited concern about the safety of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply run to the Gulf .
Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulf and U . S . officials have said that Teheran has recently equipped itself with powerful Chinese and Italian - made anti - ship missiles , posing a greater threat .
COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION Costa Rica has agreed to sell more than 32 , 000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union , a spokesman for local producers said .
Miguel Alfaro , president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry , said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Rica ' s quota for sugar exports to the U . S . Alfaro said up to 45 , 000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal , which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic .
A Soviet ship will load 25 , 000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday , Alfaro said , and a second ship will take an additional 7 , 107 tonnes two days later .
Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold .

NEW CHIEF ELECTED FOR WORLD SUGAR ORGANISATION Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over as executive director of the International Sugar Organization ( ISO ) in mid - April , ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff said .
Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end - February last year .
Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the " house in order " by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions .
Once this is done , time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement ( ISA ) with economic clauses , he said .
Ricart , currently the Dominican Republic ' s ambassador to Austria , the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva , said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia , Brazil , Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact .
INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED The International Sugar Agreement ( ISA ) will be renegotiated , International Sugar Organization ( ISO ) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact ' s council .
A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May .
The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses , but a different voting and budgetary structure , or a Geneva - based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses , he said .
But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world ' s four major exporters -- Australia , Brazil , Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today ' s special session was called because the U . S . earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget .
At today ' s council session Politoff said the U . S . would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50 , 000 stg later this year .
Currently , about three quarters of this year ' s ISO 800 , 000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U . S . caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact .
The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out .
Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half .
The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade .
The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19 .
There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO .

OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN Whether the European Community ' s Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U . S . retaliation is uncertain , an EC official said .
" It is very far from certain that it will go through ," Sir Roy Denman , Head of the EC Delegation in Washington , told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association .
Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past .
U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved , as it would limit U . S . soybean exports to the EC .
Council action is expected soon .
Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks , it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track .
" The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) wording ... but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic ," he said .

SENATE WANTS JAPAN SEMICONDUCTER PACT ENFORCED The U . S . Senate has unanimously called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its markets to U . S . Chipmakers .
The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high - technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan ' s violations of the semiconductor pact .
While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action , Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue .
" We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter ," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate .
Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan ' s unfair trade practices .
A key House trade lawmaker , Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years .
REAGAN SAYS U . S . MUST DO MORE TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL
REAGAN SAYS U . S . MUST DO MORE TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL
REAGAN SAYS U . S .
NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil .
President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U . S . reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying .
" We have to study this more ," Reagan said .
" This is why we increased the Strategic ( Petroleum ) Reserve , but we have to do more ," he said .
Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production .
However , he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures .
The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U . S . reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining .
It suggested options for the administration to consider , but made no specific recommendations .
TAIWAN ' S EXPORT ORDERS FALL IN FEBRUARY Export orders for Taiwanese products fell 1 . 37 pct to 3 . 58 billion U . S . Dlrs in February from 3 . 63 billion in January , but rose nearly 43 pct from 2 . 51 billion a year earlier , an Economic Ministry official said .
He attributed the fall to the rising Taiwan dollar .
February orders for electric and electronic goods were 619 mln U . S . Dlrs , up from 574 mln in January and 370 mln in February 1986 .
Garment orders were 324 mln dlrs against 383 mln and 283 mln while footwear orders were 297 mln compared with 333 mln and 200 mln .
BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE About 9 , 000 miners employed by the state corporation , Comibol , declared a general strike as from midnight ( 0400 gmt ) to press for higher salaries , a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said .
It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry .
The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro , but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers ' demands .
The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four - day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker , which starts on Friday .
The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday .
The government has sacked about 20 , 000 miners from its deficit - ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin .
The lay - offs represent about two - thirds of the original workforce .
CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai , which is seriously congested , a port official said .
Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17 . 95 mln tonnes of cargo last year , up from 10 . 44 mln in 1985 , but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes .
Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986 .
Jiang said Ningbo is under - utilised because of its inadequate facilities , including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou , where it joins the national network .
Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia .
The docks can handle ships of up to 150 , 000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200 , 000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour .
Most of Ningbo ' s port infrastructure has been built since 1979 , official publications show .
A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986 - 90 five - year plan , Jiang said .
" The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995 .
By 2000 , maybe , we will overtake Shanghai ," he added .
VOLCKER SAYS U . S . TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the U . S . Trade deficit is a challenge for the U . S .
Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik .
" The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s , when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement ," he said in an address to Florida educators .
He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U . S . Educational system to improve economic performance .
The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation ' s trade gap , calculated on a balance - of - payments basis , swelled to a record 38 . 37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147 . 71 billion dlrs .
Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading , writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast - changing economic climate .
Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low - income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics .
SHORT - TERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON Japanese short - term interest rates , buoyed recently by seasonal factors , are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins , money traders said .
The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23 , they said .
The Bank cut the rate to 2 . 5 pct from three , and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end - of - fiscal - year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions .
Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases , the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure , money traders said .
Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short - term rates , they said .
Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September .
This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17 , 830 billion yen by the end - December , a three - fold increase on end - December 1985 levels , bankers said .
On March 31 , the money market expects to see a 2 , 000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds , money traders said .
From April 1 , they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3 . 5000 pct from 3 . 7500 pct today and the one - month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3 . 7500 pct from 4 . 0635 pct .
They predict the three - month bill discount rate to slip to 3 . 875 pct from 4 . 0000 today and the three - month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4 . 10 / 4 . 15 from 4 . 35 / 25 .
KRUNG THAI BANK TO TAKE OVER SAYAM BANK The state - owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd will start taking over state - owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete the process in a year , Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told a press conference .
He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition between the two state - owned institutions .
The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts , while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai ' s name .
Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance Ministry took over and re - named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd . Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986 .
At the end of 1985 the bank , with 13 . 8 billion baht of assets , was ranked 12th among Thailand ' s 16 local commercial banks .
Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private management and was taking legal action to collect another four to five billion baht of doubtful debts .
Krung Thai is Thailand ' s third largest bank .
SENIOR DELEGATES PESSIMISTIC ON ICO TALKS Efforts to break an impasse between coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to have failed , senior delegates said after a contact group meeting .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little - understood El Nino weather pattern , & lt ; Accu - Weather Inc >, a commercial weather forecasting service , said .
Rice and wheat farmers in China , wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts , offical reports , government officials and meteorologists said .
Wen Wei Po , a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links , said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months .
Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces , it added .
Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February , the lowest figure for over 20 years , the paper said .
The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers , it added .
This has resulted in reduced hydro - electric power , causing shortages to industry and households .
The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground , Wen Wei Po said .
Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China , media reports said .
The People ' s Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February .
The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 .
Severe drought is affecting about one - third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country ' s tea crop , Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia , concern is growing about below - average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia ' s wheat belt , local Meteorological Bureau officials said .
For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat , the prospect of a dry autumn / winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does , they added .
Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 / 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino , they said .
Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia - Pacific region ' s disrupted weather patterns to any single cause , El Nino ' s role is being closely studied , they said .
Accu - Weather Inc , which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests , said each El Nino ' event ' was unique .
The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982 / 83 , it said .
El Nino , Spanish for " Christ Child " because it appears around Christmas , is formed by the action of warm air , bearing clouds and rain , shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru , where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds , meteorologists said .
The winds , strengthened by El Nino ' s " pump " effect , raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia , they said .
When the winds drop , the ocean , seeking equilibrium , sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru , they said .
One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain - bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific , where they further disrupt other weather patterns .
The prospects for an end to the droughts vary , Accu - Weather said .
China , where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall , will have to wait for the May - September rains , it said .
The May - September rains normally provide the drought - striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall .
In Australia , areas of Queensland ' s coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season , but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end .
In Sri Lanka , the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year .
The year ' s secondary rains usually occur between April and June , although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual .

PHILIPPINE COPPER SMELTER FACES SHIPMENT DELAYS Copper shipments are likely to be delayed because of power problems at & lt ; Philippine Associated Smelting and Refining Corp > ( PASAR ), the country ' s only smelter , a company official said .
Asked to confirm reports by New York copper trade sources about PASAR ' s shipment problems , marketing manager Deogracias Madrid told Reuters , " They are partly correct .
There could be a probable delay .
" Madrid declined to give more details , or production and export figures , saying the information could lead to speculation .
PASAR ' s smelter is in the central province of Leyte .
The New York trade sources said if PASAR ' s shipments were delayed , customers might have to turn to the London Metal Exchange for supply .
" We have a commitment to our customers and I would not like to comment on that ," Madrid said .
A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine copper production amounted to 222 , 644 tonnes in 1986 , down slightly from 226 , 157 tonnes in 1985 .
She said production in the first two months of 1987 totalled 34 , 550 tonnes , compared with 36 , 462 tonnes in the same 1986 period .

Brazilian February output rose 9 . 2 pct from year - earlier levels to 1 . 73 mln tonnes and that in South Korea was up 7 . 5 pct at 1 . 17 mln tonnes .
The 30 countries covered by the figures account for about 97 pct of world non - Communist steel production , the Institute said .
GUINNESS STARTS COURT ACTION AGAINST SAUNDERS Guinness Plc & lt ; GUIN . L > said it has started court proceedings against former chairman and chief executive Ernest Saunders and non - executive director Thomas Ward for recovery of 5 . 2 mln stg .
The money was paid to Ward via Marketing and Acquisition Consultants Ltd in Jersey .
Guinness said earlier it would propose a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove Saunders and Ward as directors of the company .
Earlier this month , lawyers for Ward told a Jersey court that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year ' s takeover battle for & lt ; Distillers Co Plc >.
Guinness has said that both men breached their fiduciary duty in authorising the payment .

INDIA DETAILS RAIN / FLOOD DAMAGE TO GRAIN IN 1986 Rain and floods in India last year damaged about 69 , 000 tonnes of grain intended for human consumption during storage and transportation , food and civil supplies minister H . K . L . Bhagat told Parliament .
He did not give comparative figures and said the government - owned Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) had not yet decided whether these grains could be used as cattle feed .
Bhagat said the FCI had a total of 16 . 43 mln tonnes of food grains in its warehouses at the end of 1986 .
It had asked state governments to build more warehouses to avoid damage to grains .
TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS The death of the world ' s tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters , scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation ( ITTO ) said .
At stake is the ability of developing nations , including Brazil , Mexico and the Philippines , to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals , they said .
The experts , gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week , said the problem is already acute .
The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers .
" For many third world nations , the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources ," said Delfin Ganapin , a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact .
" In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest , now we have one mln .
We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left .
With a 26 billion dlr debt , the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious ," he said .
About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops .
Government security advisers say that as a direct result , the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas , said Ganapin .
Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival .
There is no known way to reproduce the wood , or the millions of species within .
" No replanting programme has been successful ," said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation .
Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines .
The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks , the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short - term debts at the cost of long - term insolvency .
Yet timber , a five billion dlr a year industry , is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests , and nations must be educated in how best to " farm " them , said Peter Kramer , World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) conservation director .
There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan , and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year , he said .
U . S . Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U . S .
Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests .
Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research , develop and produce man - made substitutes , at a cost which scientists say is incalculable .
By the year 2000 , only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber , from 33 currently , and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6 . 8 billion dlrs to less than two billion , a World Bank and U . N .
Sponsored survey said .
Of the 20 . 3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank , Inter - American , African and Asian Development Banks in 1980 - 84 , only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects , it said .
WWF statistics show half of the world ' s tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s .
Of 2 , 000 mln hectares remaining , up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers .
BANK OF FINLAND WILL ANNOUNCE NEW MEASURES The Bank of Finland called a news conference at 1200 GMT to announce new measures for the " development of the system of monetary control .

GERMAN VEBA PLACEMENT SAID LIKELY EARLY NEXT WEEK The placement of the German federal government ' s 25 . 6 pct stake in utility Veba AG & lt ; VEBG . F > would probably take place early next week , banking sources said .
Share dealers said speculation had arisen in the early pre - bourse market that the Veba announcement could come as early as today .

BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE About 9 , 000 miners employed by the state corporation , Comibol , declared a general strike as from midnight ( 0400 gmt ) to press for higher salaries , a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said .
It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry .
The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro , but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers ' demands .
The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four - day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker , which starts on Friday .
The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday .
The government has sacked about 20 , 000 miners from its deficit - ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin .
The lay - offs represent about two - thirds of the original workforce .
KLM EXPANDS TALKS WITH BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH KLM Royal Dutch Airways & lt ; KLM . AS > said it agreed to take full control of a partially owned Dutch - based parcel delivery service and will offer a minority stake in it to British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc & lt ; BCOM . L > KLM , seeking to strengthen its market position in the fast growing door - to - door delivery market , said it agreed with Dutch retailer Vendex International & lt ; VENN . AS > to take over Vendex ' s 50 - pct in their jointly - owned courier , & lt ; XP System VOF >.
Ownership of XP will now be brought into the talks started by KLM last week with British and Commonwealth for a one - third stake in the latter ' s & lt ; IML Air Services Group Ltd > courier .
When announcing the negotiations with British and Commonwealth last week , KLM said buying a minority stake in IML could involve a convertible loan issue .
A KLM spokeswoman said the Dutch flag carrier would now offer a minority stake in XP to British and Commonwealth in the negotiations on IML , but declined to elaborate on financial aspects of the talks .
She said KLM would like the two courier services to cooperate in future and did not exclude a future merger between them to combine IML ' s strong world - wide network with XP ' s mainly European activities .

RAINBOW SAYS BRIERLEY UPSETTING PROGRESSIVE MERGER & lt ; Rainbow Corp Ltd > said & lt ; Brierley Investments Ltd > ( BIL ) is trying to disrupt Rainbow ' s planned merger with & lt ; Progressive Enterprises Ltd >.
Rainbow chairman Allan Hawkins said in a statement , " In our opinion BIL have deliberately tried to create anomalies in the market prices of Rainbow and Progressive shares since the merger was announced .
" The merger , announced in February , involves the formation of a new company , & lt ; Astral Pacific Corp Ltd >, which Rainbow and Progressive shareholders will enter into on a one - for - one share basis .
Both boards have approved the merger .
BIL has said it was the mystery bidder behind a recent stand in the market for three mln Progressive shares .
" We simply regard Progressive Enterprises shares to be worth approximately twice as much as Rainbow shares and do not think the merger , as proposed , is soundly based ," BIL chief executive Paul Collins said in an interview in the weekly National Business Review newspaper published today .
Collins was not immediately available to respond directly to Hawkins ' statement .
Hawkins said the merger has been assessed by independent consultants and declared fair in all respects , with benefits to all shareholders .
" We are not going to stand by while other parties distort the picture for their own strategic purposes and distract the market away from the real benefits of the merger ," he said .
" In our opinion , BIL ' s actions are clearly not designed to be in the long term interests of either Progressive or Rainbow shareholders ," Hawkins said .

TAIWAN PLANS MISSION TO CLOSE TRADE GAP WITH U . S . Taiwan ' s leading industrial organisation said it will send its first buying mission to the U . S . Later this year in an effort to reduce the country ' s trade surplus with Washington .
A spokesman for the Chinese National Federation of Industries told Reuters the mission was part of a broader plan to switch large purchases to the U . S . From Japan .
The Federation groups all of Taiwan ' s major industrial associations .
Last year its members purchased about 4 . 5 billion U . S . Dlrs worth of industrial products from Japan and about 1 . 8 billion from the U . S .
The spokesman said Federation members were now discussing the volume of business they could transfer to America .
He said they had drawn up a list of about 80 industrial products they would be shopping for in the U . S . During the buying mission in September , but he could give no figure on how much would be spent .
A Board of Foreign Trade official told Reuters the government would send two buying missions to America between June and July this year and might send others later .

SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS , SHARE DISCLOSURE A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory , continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share .
In comments at a news conference of & lt ; Vontobel Holding AG >, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks ' own self - regulating bodies , such as the Swiss Admissions Board , to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in .
A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers .
Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U . S .
Agencies , which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems .
" We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people ," he said .
The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated , he said .
Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies , worried about takeovers , increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares .
However , both types of issue had a drawback , he said .
The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG & lt ; JACZ . Z > to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg & lt ; HERZ . Z > had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company ' s statutes .
Excessive issue of participation certificates , which do not carry voting rights , would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament .
" People buying , for example , more than five pct of a company ' s shares should be made to declare their purchase ," he said .
ITALIAN JANUARY INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS 3 . 4 PCT Italian industrial production fell 3 . 4 pct in January , compared with the same month last year , the national statistics institute Istat said .
The rise follows a year - on - year increase in December 1986 of 4 . 5 pct .
Istat ' s industrial production index , base 1980 , not seasonally adjusted , registered 93 . 3 , compared with 96 . 6 in January 1986 .
Istat said there were 20 working days in January , the same as December , but one fewer than January last year .
Istat said the year - on - year fall reflected poorer performances in the footwear , clothing , textiles , chemicals and metals industries .
It said office machinery and data sectors , wood and furniture , precision mechanics , oil and electricity showed improved activity .
Calculations based on Istat figures showed industrial production rose 2 . 4 pct in January , on a month - on - month basis , after falling 12 . 0 pct in December over November .

REAGAN SAYS U . S .
NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil .
President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U . S . reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying .
" We have to study this more ," Reagan said .
" This is why we increased the Strategic ( Petroleum ) Reserve , but we have to do more ," he said .
Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production .
However , he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures .
The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U . S . reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining .
It suggested options for the administration to consider , but made no specific recommendations .

BONN EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR U . S . ON EC VEG OIL TAX The West German government expressed support for the U . S .
Position in opposing the proposed European Community tax on vegetable oils and fats , a U . S . Embassy spokesman said .
The spokesman , speaking from Bonn , said , " We have good reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the proposed tax .
" Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture , the spokesman said .
European agriculture was facing severe problems , but both the Community and the U . S . Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , he said .
The delegations will continue their top level meetings in Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the U . S . At the weekend .
The EC and the U . S . Realised the tax issue would stay on the agenda for several months and there were indications that both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations , the spokesman said .
SENATE WANTS JAPAN SEMICONDUCTER PACT ENFORCED The U . S . Senate has unanimously called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its markets to U . S . Chipmakers .
The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high - technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan ' s violations of the semiconductor pact .
While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action , Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue .
" We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter ," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate .
Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan ' s unfair trade practices .
A key House trade lawmaker , Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years .
FLEET & lt ; FLT > COULD FACE CONNECTICUT DIVESTITURE Fleet Financial Group said it might have to sell its First Connecticut Corp subsidiary as a result of its proposed 1 . 3 billion dlr acquisition of Norstar Bancorp & lt ; NOR >.
Under Connecticut banking law , New England based bank holding companies such as Fleet are not allowed to operate Connecticut banks if they merge with companies from outside the region .
Norstar is based in Albany , N . Y . First Connecticut has assets of about two billion dlrs .
Fleet has total assets of about 21 billion dlrs .
Fleet said it will seek to have the Connecticut law amended to allow it to retain First Connecticut , which is based in Hartford .
Fleet ' s acquisition of Norstar is now expected to be completed around July 1 , 1988 , when a change in laws in Fleet ' s home state of Rhode Island allowing interstate banking outside New England will go into effect .
JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS Japan ' s economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus , international monetary sources said .
At a meeting this week in Paris , senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus , they said .
Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen ' s sharp rise against the dollar , they still tend to surge when growth picks up , according to the OECD .
As a solution , the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export - driven economy , boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy , they said .
That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund ' s executive board .
The monetary sources said Japan ' s policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country ' s economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members .
The United States , which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan ' s fiscal stance , joined in the attack , he said .
The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government ' s forecast of 3 . 5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1 .
Most independent forecasters , including the IMF , believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct , monetary sources said .
The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard - hit by the yen ' s rise .
The yen ' s climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market .
Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus , which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs .
Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen , Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently .
The yen closed here today at 151 . 53 to the dollar .
Most Japanese politicians , including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa , are clearly hoping the yen will weaken , government officials said .
At a meeting in Paris last month , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the United States and West Germany , agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels .
Officials said that wording represented a compromise .
Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months , before it weakens later in the year .
Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar , perhaps by substituting the word " recent " for " current ," while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar ' s weaker levels now , perhaps by use of the word " present ," they said .
In the months leading up the February 22 agreement , the dollar dropped some 10 yen .
The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U . S . Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1 . 87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U . S . Currency .
Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts , which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen .
Officials said there are already signs of that .
More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad , they said .
GEODOME & lt ; GOEDF > TO START MINE CONSTRUCTION Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co ' s & lt ; RTN > Stearns Catalytic unit , it will proceed with construction and pre - production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County , Idaho , as quickly as possible .
The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3 , 302 , 000 short tons grading 0 . 077 ounce of gold per ton .
It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626 , 000 tons of ore per year , with higher - grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs .
The company said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41 , 000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50 , 000 ounces a year over the first three years , with 99 , 000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune life .
Capital costs would be 22 . 3 mln dlrs with all - new equipment and 500 , 000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment , it said .
It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome .
Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations .
It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0 . 046 ounce of gold and 2 . 1 ounces of silver per ton .
Also excluded are reserves of 1 , 400 , 000 tons of low - grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold .
The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price .
Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years , in constant dollars .

JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , is still under way and will be completed sometime next month .
The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far , and they said Japan would comment on the final results .
A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies .
The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries .
Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study , the agriculture ministry officials said .
OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid - May .
One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979 - 81 .
Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then , partly because of tight budgetary policy , and foreign currency factors have also changed , he said .
" The study is ...
Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country , such as geography ," the source said .
He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world .
" This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan ' s farm market further , but this would have little impact on Japan ' s agriculture policy ," he said , without giving further details .
A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community , but Japan is a major importer , he said .
VOLCKER SAYS TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the U . S . Trade deficit is a challenge for the U . S .
Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik .
" The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s , when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement ," he said in an address to Florida educators .
He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U . S . Educational system to improve economic performance .
The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation ' s trade gap , calculated on a balance - of - payments basis , swelled to a record 38 . 37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter , bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147 . 71 billion dlrs .
Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading , writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast - changing economic climate .
Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low - income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics .

HIGH WINDS KEEP VESSELS TRAPPED IN BALTIC ICE Strong south - easterly winds were keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and Swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic for many years , the Finnish Board of Navigation said .
In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be stuck in the ice , and even the largest of the assisting icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the stranded ships , coastguard officials said .
However , icy conditions in the southern Baltic at the Soviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased , they said .
Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy conditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years , with ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving .
In the coastal stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia , which divides Finland and Sweden , the ice is up to one metre thick , with drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrable walls three metres high , Swedish coastguard officials said .
Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but a further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a standstill , the officials said .
EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS The European Community ( EC ) and Soviet - led Comecon ended talks here , having made progress on setting up formal trade relations , but no breakthrough because of Comecon ' s refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC , delegates said .
Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non - recognition .
John Maslen , head of the EC delegation , told Reuters as he emerged from the final session : " We made some progress , but we have called for another meeting .
" Officials , who asked not to be named , said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12 - nation EC .
Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC .
An EC negotiator taking part in the three - day talks said : " We wanted the territorial clause in , but Comecon said no .
" A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions , but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work .
Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community ' s Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon .
Zdzislaw Kuroski , deputy director of Comecon , who heads the East bloc delegation , told Reuters ahead of today ' s session : " We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions , but not on all questions .
" Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community , he replied : " This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented .
" West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC - Comecon agreement .
The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first - ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January .
The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non - recognition of Comecon .
Last year , the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states , about half the deficit of the previous year , due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC .
OHIO EDISON & lt ; OEC > SELLS 30 PCT OF NUCLEAR INTEREST Ohio Edison Co said it has completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant , receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest .
The utility said the share of its interest in the 1 , 205 megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional investors which leased it back to the company for a period of about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate .
Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high - interest long - term debt .
Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments , but it said the " payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company will need to cover our investment in Perry , which translates into savings for our customers .
" The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs .
It plans on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year .
It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the investors because they could take quicker advantage of tax benefits than the utility could .
GEODOME SETS IDAHO GOLD / SILVER MINE CONSTRUCTION Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co ' s Stearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and pre - production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County , Idaho , as quickly as possible .
The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3 , 302 , 000 short tons grading 0 . 077 ounce of gold per ton .
It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626 , 000 tons of ore per year , with higher - grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs .
It said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41 , 000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50 , 000 ounces a year over the first three years , with 99 , 000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life .
Capital costs would be 22 . 3 mln dlrs with all - new equipment and 500 , 000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment , the firm said .
It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome .
Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations .
It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0 . 046 ounce of gold and 2 . 1 ounces of silver per ton .
Also excluded are reserves of 1 , 400 , 000 tons of low - grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold .
The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price .
Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years , in constant dollars .
STANLEY INTERIORS & lt ; STHF > SAYS RESULTS REDUCED Stanley Interiors Corp said its first quarter shipments and operating income were lower than expected due to snowstorms in January and February that forced the closing of some of its manufacturing facilities for up to six days .
Stanley said , however , that any reduction in first quarter operating income will be offset by reduced interest expense and that first quarter net income will be about flat with first quarter 1986 net income of 14 cts a share , or 286 , 000 dlrs .
Stanely also said the first quarter ' s sales losses would be made up by shipments in the second quarter .

As a result of the agreement , the court removed a previous temporary restraining order against TWA , the company said .
TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23 .
TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to regulatory agencies on the USAir , Piedmont merger .

AMERICAN MOTORS & lt ; AMO > BOARD MEETING ON TAKEOVER American Motors Corp ' s board of directors is meeting this morning in New York to consider Chrysler Corp ' s & lt ; C > 1 . 5 billion dlr takeover offer , an American Motors spokesman said .
The spokesman reiterated statements made earlier in the week that the regularly scheduled meeting was being held .
The spokesman would not comment on recurring speculation that the board might receive a higher offer from Chrysler .
Analysts have said the fact that American Motors ' stock has remained above the four dlrs a share Chrysler offer could lead the larger company to raise its bid .
The American Motors spokesman said he had not seen any indication that a higher offer would be received from Chrysler , although he added , " I don ' t know what the conversation is in the meeting .
" He repeated statements made earlier in the week by the automaker that today ' s meeting will probably not result in a final decision on the Chrysler bid .
" The board first apprised the proposal on the 11th ( of March ).
I suspect there will be several more ( meetings ) after this ," the spokesman said .
The meeting is expected to go through early afternoon .
KEATING SEES LOWER AUSTRALIAN CURRENT DEFICIT Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country ' s 1986 / 87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14 . 7 billion forecast in the August budget .
Keating told a financiers ' dinner that February ' s 750 mln dlr deficit , against January ' s 1 . 23 billion , was " in the groove " of the government ' s expectations .
" We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion , I think , which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget ," Keating said .
" I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP .
" Australia posted a 13 . 82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985 / 86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend .
Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election , because it would take time to stabilise Australia ' s 80 billion dlr foreign debt .
" We have to build the import competing sector back ," he said .
" We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure .
We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing .
" Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation .
The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14 , he said .
TREASURY ' S BAKER SUPPORTS FED MONETARY POLICY Treasury Secretary James Baker said in a newspaper interview that he supports the current course of Federal Reserve Board monetary policy .
" The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we are concerned ," Baker said in an interview with the New York Times .
In the interview , Baker declined to comment about the recent Paris accord among the six leading industrialized democracies when he was asked why the U . S . agreed to stabilize the dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a record level last year .
Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was " a subject I prefer not to talk about .
" He said that if he explained why the U . S . agreed to help maintain the dollar at current levels " I would of necessity end up getting into some of the private agreements that support such and agreement " on the dollar .
Baker was optimistic about Brazil , which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks .
" They are , after all , paying on time all the debt service and principal on their official debts , having just rescheduled with the Paris Club ," Baker said in the newspaper interview .
Baker said that Brazilian repreentatives had explained they intented to pay their commercial bank debts in full but needed time .

ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR PUROLATOR & lt ; PCC > Several analysts said they do not believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for Purolator Courier Corp by E . F . Hutton LBO Inc and a management group from Purolator ' s courier division .
There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming , but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers ' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued .

Purolator ' s stock slipped 3 / 8 today to close at 34 - 3 / 4 .
It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday .

Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares .
If all shares are tendered , shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash , six dlrs in debentures , and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U . S . courier operation .
Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share .
Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton .
The sources would not reveal the amount of the fee , which will be noted in documents on the transaction to be made public later this week .

BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS ' CERTIFICATES The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks ' certificates of deposits ( CDs ) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market .
Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30 , 1987 , by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling .
" The recent introduction of three - month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments ," Kullberg said .
Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market .
The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs , they said .
" The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country ," one banker said .
Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7 . 5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves .
A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded .
Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland ' s monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own - CDs .
" We are free to do it , so maybe on Monday we will issue the first , just to see how the system functions .
Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week ," Korkman told Reuters .
He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three - month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity .
The Bank of Finland introduced last December three - month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market .
Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week , while three - month credits have risen to three to four billion .
On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks ' CDs , estimated to be some eight billion markka .
In addition , commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion .

MCDONALD ' S & lt ; MCD > UP ON REAFFIRMED RECOMMENDATION The stock of McDonald ' s Corp rose sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock , traders said .
McDonald ' s , an operator of fast food restaurants , rose 1 - 5 / 8 to 77 - 3 / 8 .
" Comparable store sales are up 5 . 6 pct in 1986 vs 1985 ," Lee said , " and the stock is trading below the market multiple .
" He said " not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual earnings growth rate , return on equity above 20 pct , but trade at less than the market multiple .
" Analyst Lee said " the introduction of a new line of salads this spring , at about the time we are all trying to squeeze into bathing suits , should boost sales .
" He also noted that " the average McDonald ' s does about 1 . 369 mln dlrs in revenues a year .
That compares with 1 . 1 mln dlrs a year for the average Burger King and 800 , 000 dlrs a year for the average Wendy ' s .
" Since it cost about the same to build a single store for any one of these chains , he said , " McDonald ' s can well justify their expansion .
" Lee expects McDonald ' s to earn 4 . 40 dlrs a share in 1986 and 5 . 15 dlrs in 1988 .
Last year it earned 3 . 72 dlrs a share .

ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks , but these should not constitute a " dominant " holding , an Italian government committee ruled .
The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings , headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria , said its decision reflected the " need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non - financial concerns .
" It did not quantify what might constitute a " dominant " holding .
The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them , and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks .
Under the ruling , credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank ' s capital must not exceed defined limits .
The value of credits given cannot exceed either one - fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two - fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned .
Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks .
Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions .
The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank ' s capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms .

TALKING POINT / FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION & lt ; FBT > First City Bancorporation ' s sale of 54 mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential - Bache should significantly reduce its energy problems , but the bank ' s losses are still virtually guaranteed to continue , analysts said .
The package of energy loans was sold at book value , so First City did not to show a gain or loss , said bank spokesman James Day .
He added it was possible First City would sell more of the bank ' s remaining 1 . 4 billion dlrs in oil - related loans to raise cash .
The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and to oilfield service and supply companies .
Day said some had already been classified as nonperforming , or charged off as a loss , but he could not identify how many were included in those categories .
The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache ' s Energy Growth Fund , a limited partnership created last month with 90 mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties .
First City , the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn in oil prices , lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986 and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other capital assistance .
The Houston - based bank ' s nonperforming assets totaled 897 . 1 mln dlrs at yearend , up from 563 . 1 mln dlrs at the end of 1985 Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in the troubled bank unless government assistance is available .
" Their problems are not just limited to energy .
They have a substantial portfolio in real estate .
This sale in and of itself won ' t make the company look better to a potential buyer ," said Ray Archibold , a banking analyst with McCarthy , Crisanti and Maffei Inc . " It does reduce the bank ' s exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount ," Archibold said , " but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans .
" Of First City ' s total loan portfolio of 9 . 9 mln dlrs , about 14 pct or 1 . 4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers , analysts said .
Its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation ' s top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s .
First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential came from its Energy Finance Co ., an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to " more venturesome " oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return .
The other half of the loans were from First City ' s lead bank in Houston .
Chris Kotowski , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co ., said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from First City in months .
" It ' s not going to solve all of First City ' s problems but it ' s a good transaction for them .
It may be possible for them to sell additional loans ," Kotowski said .
" Prudential can fund these things more cheaply than First City and there ' s an incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as values are depressed " In a statement , First City chairman J . A .
Elkins said the bank ' s strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to total loans .
" This move , which we believe is the first transaction of its kind , helps us further , and we were able to make it without suffering a loss .

JAPAN , BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L > is resisting attempts to merge two Japan - based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans , a company executive said .
Cable and Wireless , which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms , is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm , director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters .
That plan , put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry , has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market .
Pacific Telesis Group & lt ; PAC . N > of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia , & lt ; International Digital Communications Inc > ( IDC ).
Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U . S . Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger .
A key U . S . Senate committee , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger , he said .
The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to & lt ; Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd >, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan .
The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm .
In an attempt to hammer out an agreement , Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe , the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger .
But the two sides remained deadlocked .
At stake is C and W ' s 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska , to form part of its global network .
" C and W wants to start right away on the project , such as application and other procedures ," said Watanabe , who is also chairman of & lt ; Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc >.
The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm , after the merger .
" These decisions ( on the merger ) were made in consideration of Japan ' s economic conditions and legal systems .
I told him we are not a colony or something ," said Watanabe .

GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY West Germany ' s money supply growth slowed in February after January ' s sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward , the Bundesbank said in a statement .
Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February .
While cash in circulation , deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply , short - term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January .
In the six months to February , M3 , which excludes holdings of German non - banks abroad , grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8 . 5 pct after 9 . 8 in the six months to January .
Compared with February 1986 , M3 rose 7 - 1 / 2 pct .
In the six months to February , M2 , which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice , rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8 . 8 pct and M1 , which consists of cash and sight deposits , rose seven pct .
International transactions of non - banks again led to a significant inflow of funds , the Bundesbank said .
Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners , refecting these foreign payments , increased by 9 . 1 billion marks in February , little changed from January ' s rise .
But in contrast to January , the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth , the Bundesbank said .
Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February .
A sharp drop in short - term company credits , which reflected the foreign funds inflow , was balanced by a moderate rise in long - term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities .
At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4 - 1 / 2 pct above the February 1986 level .
The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive , the Bundesbank said .
Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper , public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank .
Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January .
A total of 7 . 7 billion marks in long - term funds was placed with banks after 6 . 6 billion the previous month .

EC SAYS U . S .
BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZO - DUPONT ROW The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch - made fibres from the U . S . Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT .
In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington , the executive authority alleged that a section of the U . S .
Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically - produced goods .
The Commission said it would ask Geneva - based GATT to rule on whether the section in question , which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters , conformed to its rules .
Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if , after a GATT decision against it , Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules .
The executive ' s decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo & lt ; AKZO . AS >, whose " aramid " synthetic fibres have been banned from the U . S . Market because of charges by the U . S . Firm & lt ; Dupont > that the fibres violate the American company ' s patents .
Akzo alleged that the ban , imposed by the U . S . International Trade Commission ( ITC ), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions .
The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U . S .
Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction over imported products .
The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U . S . Court .
" Consequently the procedure followed ... Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States ," it said in a statement .

HOUSTON METALS ' MINE YIELDS POSITIVE RESULTS & lt ; Houston Metals Corp > said the the first phase of the underground rehabilitation , extensive drilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine has yielded positive results .
Houston said representative assays from the 2 , 750 ft and 2 , 600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established ore deposits in the following ranges : copper , 3 . 7 pct to 5 . 08 pct , lead . 99 pct to 1 . 5 pct , zinc six pct to 9 . 6 pct , silver 15 . 63 pct to 79 . 92 oz per ton , gold . 062 to . 19 oz per ton , germanium 93 to 103 grams per ton , gallium five to 18 grams per ton .
In addition , Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25 diamond - drilled holes 375 ft below the 2 , 600 foot level and 800 ft along the strike assayed gold at . 237 oz per ton , silver at 10 . 91 oz per ton and zinc at 8 . 99 pct .
An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2 , 600 ft level returned similar values , the company said .
It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial feasability of producing a zinc and a copper - lead concentrate .
Houston Metals said gold , silver and the base metals have recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct , with 95 pct of gold recovered from better gold ores , while gallium , germanium and indium have recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the zinc concentrate .
The company ' s 1987 program of diamond drilling , underground drifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start on April .
Houston Metals said it has a 60 pct interest in the Silver Queen mines .
It added that funds for the program have been provided by First Exploration Fund , a Canadian limited partnership sponsored by Merrill Lynch Canada Inc and Dominion Securities Inc .

USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices , an Agriculture Department offical said .
" We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing ," said Bob Sindt , USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations .
U . S . grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement .
But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes .
" If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing , we are not considering this ," he said .
Sindt , however , did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system .
" We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy ," he said .
" If we become convinced that we need to make a change , then appropriate adjustments will be made .
" Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA ' s price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates .
He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week .
Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting , including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums .
He defended the USDA differentials , saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease .
The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices .
When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates , Sindt discounted the idea .
He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that , under provisions of the program , these all have to be emptied by the end of March .

GATT TO DEBATE U . S . CHARGES OF AIRBUS SUBSIDIES The U . S . Will pursue its complaint that European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee , a GATT spokesman said today .
The U . S .
Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) during a special two - day session ending today .
GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce .
The 20 - member committee agreed to open debate on the U . S . Complaint , starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July , trade officials said .
" The tension has eased ," the permanent trade ambassador of the 12 - member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters .
" The U . S . Has decided to go through proper channels .
" U . S . Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus , voiced during a visit to European capitals in February .
In a letter calling for the special committee meeting , Washington charged France , West Germany , the U . K ., Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus .
The U . S . Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft .
Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view .
Official sources in the delegations said the U . S . Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices .
Some delegates said the U . S .
Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re - negotiating .
All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings .
LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U . S . trade deficit declines .
C . Fred Bergsten , a former senior Treasury Department official , and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U . S . demand for imports is expected to fall .
" They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls ," or unemployment will keep growing , Bergsten said .
Bergsten predicted the U . S . trade deficit , which hit 169 billion dlrs last year , will fall 30 - 40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar ' s 35 - 40 pct decline since September 1985 .
The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture , if the U . S . budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur , he added .
Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U . S . foreign debt .
The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline , he said .
Rimmer de Vries , senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co ., said the U . S . trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies , prolonged currency misalignment , debt problems of the developing countries , and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries .
John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute , suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U . S . trade deficit fall .

UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT A new International Natural Rubber Agreement , INRA , was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today .
The new accord is due to replace the current one , which expires in October .
Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented " a historic moment .
" The latest round of talks , which began March 9 , represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years .
Xuto described the negotiations as " by no means easy , and we often faced problems .
" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports .
The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it .
It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year .
It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now , delegates said .
During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended , but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place .
Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term .
Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies , Xuto added .
He also praised " the spirit of ' give ' and ' take ' that prevailed throughout this session .
" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia , speaking on behalf of producers , said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s .
Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is " a vital consideration for multinational tire companies , whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply .
" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created .
Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact " to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new .
Gerard Guillonneau of France , speaking for consumers , agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well .
But as economic conditions had changed , he said , consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning .
He added that the adoption of the new agreement " attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry .

ATT & lt ; T > CHAIRMAN SAYS DIVIDEND WILL NOT BE CUT American Telephone and Telegraph Co does not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a share on its common stock , said James E . Olson , chairman .
" It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the business cycle ," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts .
" We see no reason to change that policy ," he said .
Although ATT will maintain its current dividend , Olson said the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid in dividends by increasing earnings .
Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its common dividend , especially after the company posted a fourth quarter net loss of 1 . 17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts a share for the full year .
The loss included a one - time restructuring charge of 1 . 7 billion dlrs .
Olson said he expects ATT ' s cash flow to remain strong despite the poor earnings .
MAJOR TIN CENTERS PARALYSED BOLIVIA UNION SAYS A strike by 9 , 000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol has paralysed tin production in the major centers of Huanuni , Corocoro , Siglo , Catavi and Colquiri , the Conflicts Secretary of the Bolivian Miners Federation , Cristobal Aranibar , told Reuters .
The strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry .
The miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but " only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands ", Aranibar said .
The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro , faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies , has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of West German president , Richard von Weizsaecker , who arrives today for a four - day official visit .
The government froze salaries as part of its efforts to pull Bolivia out of a deep economic crisis .
According to central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct rate versus up to 20 , 000 pct in 1985 .
In addition to the miners ' strike , about 1 , 000 railway factory workers of the bolivian labour organization ( COB ) began a second day of a hunger strike in the country ' s main cities to press for substantial wage increases , a union leader said .

AMERICAN CAN & lt ; AC > SEES HIGHER YEAR NET American Can Co chairman Gerald Tsai said the company will record higher earnings in the first quarter and for the full year .
Addressing analysts , Tsai said " First quarter results have been extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 will show significant improvement over 1986 .
" American Can earned 196 . 3 mln dlrs , or 3 . 21 dlrs per share , adjusted for a two - for - one stock split , in 1986 .
In the 1986 first quarter , the company reported net income of 67 . 5 mln dlrs , including one - time gains from sale of assets , or 2 . 30 dlrs per share , before the stock adjustment .
In the 1987 first quarter , American Can will record a one - time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in its Musicland Group subsidiary .
The gain is slightly higher than the expected gain the company predicted in February because additional shares of the unit were sold .
In response to a question , Tsai said American Can ' s investment in Jefferies and Co is " very small ".
" We treat it as just another passive investment ," he said .
According to press reports , American Can owns 20 pct of Jefferies and is its largest single shareholder .
Yesterday , Boyd Jefferies , chairman and founder of the brokerage firm bearing his name , resigned from the firm and said he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking securities laws .
Responding to another question , Tsai said AIDS - related claims were a small portion of claims made with American Can ' s insurance subsidiaries in 1986 .

" The nine largest airlines now control 94 per cent of the market .

Metzenbaum said he introduced a bill to transfer antitrust authority over airline mergers to the Justice Department in hopes it would more restrictive than the Transportation Department .
GPU & lt ; GPU > SEES TMI - 2 FUEL PROBLEMS RESOLVED General Public Utilities Corp said the water - clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant appears to have been resolved .
The company said the slower than expected removal of the fuel , which has been primarily due to the water - clarity problems , is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988 .
A spokesman said the company had previously expected this to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how far into 1988 the process will extend .
It still expects to complete the entire clean - up by the end of 1988 , he added .
GPU said its auditors , Coopers and Lybrand , again qualified its opinion of GPU ' s financial statements , adding the recovery of TMI - 2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading to the qualified opinion .
GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover the costs of decommissioning TMI - 2 in future rate proceedings .
As in past years , the qualified opinion continues to list other uncertainties associated with the accident , which damaged TMI - 2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for damages that might exceed available insurance proceeds .

ATT & lt ; T > COST - CUTTING EFFORTS ON TARGET American Telephone and Telegraph Co chairman James E . Olson said he is very pleased with the company ' s efforts so far to cut costs .
He told a meeting of securities analysts that , although the company is not yet at point in its cost - cutting drive to improve profit margins , it is " on the right track .
" Olson said ATT ' s cash flow was " very strong in the first two months of the year , better than budgeted .
" While Olson does not know if the company ' s earnings and revenues will improve by yearend , he said ATT is " moving in the proper direction .
" For 1986 , ATT ' s earnings dropped to 139 mln dlrs , or five cts a share , on revenues of 34 . 1 billion dlrs , from 1 . 56 billion dlrs , or 1 . 37 dlrs a share , on revenues of 34 . 4 billion dlrs in 1985 .
During 1986 ATT took 3 . 2 billion dlrs in charges from expenses related to reducing its work force by 32 , 000 .
HUDSON ' S BAY WRITEOFF MAINLY DUE TO DOME STAKE & lt ; Hudson ' s Bay Co > said a writeoff of 40 . 4 mln dlrs , or 1 . 39 dlrs per share , that it took in 1986 was mainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd & lt ; DMP >.
The company reported an operating profit of 33 . 0 mln dlrs , or 32 cts per share , for fiscal 1986 , compared to an operating loss of 9 , 055 , 000 dlrs , or 1 . 23 dlrs per share , in the previous year .
Hudson ' s Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome ' s 10 pct series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares .

Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3 . 885 dlrs per share .
Dome is trading at 1 . 12 dlrs per share , down one ct , today on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Hudson ' s Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185 . 3 mln dlrs from 111 . 4 mln dlrs , but that was partially offset by an increase of 14 . 9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25 . 3 mln dlrs in taxes .
Hudson ' s Bay also said its Markborough properties subsidiary had an operating profit of 108 . 6 mln dlrs , up from 98 . 8 mln dlrs the year before .

Total debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2 . 28 billion dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1 . 8 to one from 2 . 1 to one .
JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U . S .
FISH Japan has agreed to drop barriers to American - caught herring and pollock , opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually , U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced .
Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo .
He said the Commerce Department estimated U . S . shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years .
There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U . S . shipments , but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms .
At the same time , Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish .
He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement .
NYMEX RULE CHANGE SEEN BOOSTING ENERGY TRADE The New York Mercantile Exchange said it will introduce exchanges for physicals ( EFPS ) to its energy futures markets April one .

CONCERN OVER " EL NINO " IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that " El Nino " may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster , which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought , the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s officer in Lima said in a field report .
Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area , flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern , the report , dated March 17 , said .
However , it said official sources still believe that this year ' s El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity .
EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific .
The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production .
Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle .
Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists , it said .
However , the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn , and slow the decline in sugar production , it said .
If El Nino picks up momentum , Peru ' s fishing industry could receive a setback .
But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5 . 5 mln tonnes in 1987 , almost 20 pct above last year , the report said .
Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters , it said .
It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March , April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest .
" There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell ," the report said .
ALLIED - LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH & lt ; Allied - Lyons PLC > will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7 , chairman Derrick Holden - Brown said in answer to reporters ' queries .
" You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied - Lyons in the second half ," Holden - Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts .
Holden - Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20 . 7 pct rise reported in the first half .
Allied - Lyons had first half profit of 148 . 0 mln stg , up from 122 . 6 mln stg in the prior year .
Allied - Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd ' s failed take - over bid for the company , Holden - Brown also said .
But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied - Lyons ' sale of its 24 . 9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey , he said .
" So with Australians , you win some and you lose some .
But hopefully you win them all in the end ," Holden - Brown said .
Asked if he thought Allied - Lyons is vulnerable to other take - over attempts , Holden - Brown replied : " No , I don ' t .
" " We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful , but I think we would be very expensive ," he said .
Holden - Brown said Allied - Lyons ' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry .
" That was not the case two years ago .
If the Australians had come a little bit earlier , they might have had more luck , I think ," Holden - Brown said .
Holden - Brown said Allied - Lyons ' move to acquire Hiram Walker - Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March , 1986 during Elders take - over bid for the company was " 100 pct a growth action .
" " We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued , and that people almost inevitably would say ( the acquisition was ) defensive , but it never was ," Holden - Brown told reporters .
Asked by securities analysts if Allied - Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker , Holden - Brown responded : " Plan might be too strong a word .
But I must say I do feel the need for Allied - Lyons to be better known in Canada .

BALLY & lt ; BLY > SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT Bally Manufacturing Corp ' s proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit , analysts said .
" In the longer - term horizon , Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses ," said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc . Last week , Bally said it was considering the sale of another non - casino unit , its Six Flags amusement park unit , which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs .
Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said " the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company , but in the long term we ' ll wait and see how the offering goes .
" Once Bally ' s biggest revenue producer , the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456 . 2 mln dlrs , 28 pct of Bally ' s revenues .
Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300 - 500 mln dlrs .
Analysts said Bally ' s decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it .
" It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit ' s debt , increase its cash flow and operating income , making it an attractive buy to a third party ," Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said .
On Monday , Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct , or 5 . 8 mln shares , of the unit ' s common stock at 13 - 15 dlrs a share .
About half the proceeds , 40 mln dlrs , will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing ' s debt which has swelled to 1 . 6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover , according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson .
Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20 - year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit , a Bally spokesperson said .
Analysts said Bally ' s health club unit ' s profits have remained strong , but are skeptical about the industry ' s long range prospects .
" The fitness club industry , over the last 10 years , has grown tremendously , but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle ," said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns .
Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness , but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes .
In addition , " the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry ," said one analyst .
There are about 6 , 500 fitness clubs in the U . S ., excluding clubs run by not - for - profit organizations , according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8 . 0 - billion - dlr - a - year industry .
Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit , which is the nation ' s largest health club chain , Peltier said , " no one has the money to offer to buy it .
" " The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization ," said Wayne LaChapelle , chief financial officer of Livingwell INc & lt ; WELL >, the nation ' s second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but " could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time .

DELTA SAYS COURT ORDER WILL NOT DELAY MERGER Delta Air Lines & lt ; DAL > said a court order requiring Western Air Lines & lt ; WAL > to arbitrate with two of its unions will not delay the April 1 merger between the two airlines .

Delta said it feels the court has erred and should reconsider the order .
ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union ' s winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter , an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said .
Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell , author of the EF Hutton publication " Global Crop News ," said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain , possibly wheat , from the U . S . due to potential crop damage .
" Compared with last year , the outlook ( for the Soviet winter grain crop ) is far more pessimistic ," she said .
" But it ' s still too early to talk about disastrous losses .
A lot will depend on spring weather , not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop , but also for spring planting .
" Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains .
Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25 - 35 pct of autumn precipitation , she said .
The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops , she said .
However , she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover , which should have well - insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage .
The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986 / June 1987 marketing year , primarily from Canada , the European Community , Argentina and Australia , Martell said .
She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand .
Last fall ' s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture - depleted pastures , while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy .
Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes , and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports .
However , she said the U . S . remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union , noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U . S . grain purchases of the 1986 / 87 season by buying 2 . 25 mln tonnes of corn .
Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U . S . is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand .
In 1984 / 85 , the U . S . supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55 . 5 mln tonnes .
But in 1985 / 86 , the Soviet Union bought 29 . 9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U . S . for only 24 pct of that total .
While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986 / 87 was 22 mln tonnes , many U . S . grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25 - 28 mln tonnes , she said .

MEXICO ' S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS Additional capital inflows of 1 . 5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico ' s reserves to about eight billion dlrs , director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters .
Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit - starved industries to repatriate capital .
Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth - quarter 1986 .
Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it .
He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment .
Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter , Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months , Gurria noted .
Nevertheless , Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks ' 1 . 2 billion dlr investment - support contingency facility .
That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico ' s export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels .
But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs , and Gurria said today , " We expect we ' ll never have to use it .
" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co - financing loan with the World Bank .
Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods .

At the company ' s annual meeting , he said an acquisition could take place in the next 24 months .

" One company being studied could possibly be acquired on a friendly basis , he said .

The company has said its possible applications include treatment of some types of hepatitis , herpes , influenza , childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers .

He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a House Subcommittee is continuing .
The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug .
Virazole is approved for marketing in the U . S . in aerosol form as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants , called respiratory syncytial virus .

EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS The European Community ( EC ) agreed tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region ' s forests .
Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide , widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes .
The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles , with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990 .
The EC ' s executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2 . 4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12 - nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards .
There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC , according to Commission figures .
The ministers also gave West Germany a go - ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol , after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low - pollution cars , diplomats said .
West Germany will still need ministers ' final approval for such a plan .
Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21 .
But the ministers added that the go - ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community - wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol .
Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps , diplomats said .
They added that , of the 97 mln cars in the EC , only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol .
Under EC law , ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws .
This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol .

LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986 / 87 - USDA Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986 / 87 , as requirments fell in many countries in Africa , the Middle East and Asia , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
In a summary of its World Agriculture Report , the department said grain production in sub - Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986 , with gains in almost every country .
However , food needs in Central America rose , worsened by drought - reduced crops and civil strife .
Record wheat production in 1986 / 87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high , and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop , it said .
However , may developing countries in tropical climates , such as Sub - Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , and Central America , are not well adapted for wheat production , and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs , the department said .
World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986 / 87 for the third straight year .
Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption , while palm oil is the most traded , the department said .
U . S . SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U . S . Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long - awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments .
In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the " Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 ", Peter Myers , Deputy Agriculture Secretary , said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop , down from 18 cts now .
Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 .
The payments would cost an estimated 1 . 1 billion dlrs , Myers said .
The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep . John Porter , R - Ill . Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist .
The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years .
It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 , 000 short tons raw sugar per grower .
For example , on the first 350 tons of production , a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 , 4 . 5 cts in 1989 , 3 cts in 1990 and 1 . 5 cts in 1991 .
The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years , whichever is less , USDA said .
Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry .
He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads .
U . S . sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a " progressive contraction " of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year , he said .
This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing .
Furthermore , USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage .
The result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of U . S . processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar .
USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U . S . consumers and industrial users .
In fiscal 1987 , USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar .
" Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing ," Myers said .
The following table lists the rate of payments , in cts per lb , to growers and the quantity covered , in short tons recoverable raw sugar , under the administration ' s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments .

LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little , if any , effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction , livestock analysts said .
The increase of 66 . 4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22 . 6 mln lbs decline in total red meats .
Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday , they said .
" I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week ," Jerry Gidel , livestock analyst for GH Miller , said .
Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week .
Also , Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week .
" We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex ," Levitt said .
Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative .
Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year , they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month ' s holdings , they said .
However , analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation .
Glenn Grimes , agronomist at the University of Missouri , said , " I would not look for ( belly ) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less .

STRIKE THREAT , LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING The St . Lawrence Seaway , set to reopen March 31 after the winter , faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes , seaway officials said .
Depressed grain exports , rising costs , and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year ' s traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2 , 300 mile waterway , officials said .
In 1986 , a season that ran from April 3 to December 27 , the seaway moved 37 . 6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41 . 6 mln tons on the Welland Canal , linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario .
By comparison , in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal - Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight - lock canal .
The waterway is expected to lose 9 - 10 mln Canadian dlrs this year , about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986 - 87 ending March 31 , said William Blair , an executive member of Canada ' s St Lawrence Seaway Authority .
The seaway moves about one - half of Canada ' s exported grain .
Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses .
The Seafarers ' International Union , which represents about 2 , 300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts , has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers ' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions .
" It ' s 99 . 9 pct ( certain )-- I guarantee you a strike ," Roman Gralewicz , head of the Seafarers ' Canadian branch , has said .
The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides .
The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic .
" We haven ' t had a strike on the seaway for years ... a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect ," Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said .
" These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway ," George Miller , vice - president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association , an association of major Canadian shipping companies , said recently .
The workers ' current contract expires May 31 .
The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years , reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching .
The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs ( U . S .) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition .
The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades .
Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year , compared to last year ' s 15 pct rise , while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway .
Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway ' s 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs .
" We may see and hope for a steady upward climb ... but we won ' t see a major increase for a number of years ," Hemsley said .
A Canada - U . S . delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won ' t be felt for several years , Blair said .
CHEMLAWN & lt ; CHEM >, ECOLAB & lt ; ECON > IN MERGER PACT Chemlawn Corp and Ecolab Inc said they signed a definitive merger agreement under which Ecolab will buy all outstanding Chemlawn common stock for 36 . 50 dlrs a share in cash , for a total of about 370 mln dlrs .
Under terms of the agreement , Chemlawn said it rescinded its previously announced rights dividend plan .
Chemlawn previously rejected a 27 dlr a share offer from Waste Management Inc & lt ; WMX >.
Yesterday , the Oak Brook , Ill .- based waste disposal company said it was prepared to offer 33 dlrs a share , or about 330 mln dlrs , for Chemlawn , a lawn - care company .
Chemlawn had said last week that it was negotiating with other possible suitors , which it did not identify .
A Chemlawn spokesman said further details on the merger would be issued later .
Ecolab is a maker of commercial laundry detergent based in St . Paul , Minn . For its first six months ended December 31 , the company earned 20 . 4 mln dlrs , or 76 cts a share , on sales of 421 . 8 mln dlrs .
Officials at Waste Management could not be reached for immediate comment .

LILCO & lt ; LIL > REVISES 1986 NET TO INCLUDE LOSS Long Island Lighting Co said it revised its preliminary 1986 net income to include a 16 mln dlrs after tax provision for its investment in the Jamesport Nuclear units .
Due to the provision , it said its revised 1986 net income was 316 . 7 mln dlrs or 2 . 13 dlrs per share after deducting for preferred stock dividend requirements , which were not paid in either 1986 or 1985 .
It had earlier reported 1986 income of 332 . 7 mln dlrs or 2 . 28 dlrs per share .

The company declined to detail the settlement , explaining the settlement has not been approved by the commission .
Lilco was seeking to include costs totaling 118 mln dlrs for the abandoned nuclear power plant project in its rate base , a spokeswoman said .

CANADA ' S CLARK SEES TRADE AS MOST URGENT PROBLEM Trade is the most urgent problem facing U . S .- Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months , Joe Clark , Canadian secretary of state for external affairs , said .
Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement .
" The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months ," Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California .
" We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve .
" Clark said that , as a practical matter , an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October .
He listed environmental questions , particularly acid rain , and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington .
On Wednesday , President Reagan announced that he will seek 2 . 5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem .
Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting , on April 5 - 6 in Ottawa , with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
In a question - and - answer session with the public affairs group , Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes .
" This rash of countervailing actions , where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests ," he said .
Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington ' s rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses , he said .
" There are a number of Canadian companies that , in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States , have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements ," he said .
In turn , he added , the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada .
Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions .
" What will come out of it remains for the negotiators , in the first instance , to propose , and then governments and congresses will have judge ," he said .
In his prepared remarks , Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted , although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan .
" Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada ," he said .

NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas , helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986 , analysts said .
The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements .
" Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year ," Michael Smolinski , an energy economist with Data Resources Inc , told Reuters .
An estimated 200 , 000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged , Smolinski said .
Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel , national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2 . 10 to 2 . 25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive , Michael German , vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said .
The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2 . 10 dlrs per mln Btu , compared with 3 . 26 dlrs a year ago .
" We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet ( of demand ) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter ( 1987 )," he said .
In addition to price competitiveness , availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas , Frank Spadine , senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp . in New York noted .
Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales .
These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year .
AGA ' s German contended that despite the drilling decline , much of U . S . proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins .
Citing recent EIA statistics , German said , the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987 , but the surplus would not go away until 1990 .
Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990 .
While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas , notably in California and in the Northeast U . S ., an overall shortfall appeared remote .
U . S .
SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips , senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige .
Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States , they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties .
President Reagan ' s trade policy advisory group , of which Baldrige is a member , will meet on the issue Wednesday .
" I am confident we will see action taken ," Sen . John McCain , an Arizona Republican , told reporters .
" I am expecting sanctions at least , and even more than sanctions ," Sen . Pete Domenici , a New Mexico Republican , said .
The senators , several congressmen and U . S . semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan ' s alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries .
They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips .
The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry , they said .
Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions , Sen . Pete Wilson told reporters , " The clear import of what he said is that there will be .
" " Japan can ' t just say they will comply .
We think sanctions must be applied ," for past violations of the agreement , the California Republican said .
The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems .
Sen . James McClure , an Idaho Republican , said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries .
But McClure said senators told him , " There is no doubt dumping is going on ," based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products .
The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U . S . semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market .
In return , the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips .
Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip - makers to further slash output to save the pact .
Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year ' s record 169 - billion - dlr trade deficit .
Tokyo had a 59 - billion - dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries .
The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September .
The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep . Bob Matsui , a California Democrat .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA Bolivia , once Latin America ' s most delinquent debtor , is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending .
A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement .
He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month .
The accord provided for a stand - by loan , a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility .
The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed , Bolivia can expect a further 60 - mln - dlr stand - by loan over the next 12 months .
Bolivia ' s agreement with the IMF , its first since 1980 , opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil , which hold 2 . 5 billion dlrs of Bolivia ' s 4 . 0 - billion - dlr foreign debt .
Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club , which have yet to be finalised , had been extremely successful .
Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia ' s debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988 .
Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue , he said .
Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies , including the World Bank and the Inter - American Development Bank , although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs .
Nogales said Bolivia ' s net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs , up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985 .
Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia ' s debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986 .
Bolivia ' s return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro ' s economic stabilisation program .
He inherited inflation of 23 , 000 pct a year , state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate .
Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages , set a market - related rate for the peso , introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations .
Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months , according to the Central Bank , and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years .
The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks , some 900 mln dlrs , on which interest has not been paid since March , 1984 .
Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one - time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10 - 15 cents on the dlr .
He said Bolivia ' s commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal , but it is still unclear what proportion of the country ' s creditor banks will take up the offer .
One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal , mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country .
But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt - equity swaps , similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years .
The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt - equity swaps , but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme .
Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run , especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow .
Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years .
The government realises that in order to remain viable , Bolivia will need to develop new exports .
The price of tin , which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia ' s exports in 1984 , has collapsed on the world markets , and gas , the country ' s major revenue earner , is in abundant supply in the region .

MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT The new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ), like the 1979 pact , will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls .
The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ).
In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one .
The reference price , currently 201 . 66 Malaysian / Singapore cts per kilo , will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22 , when the 1979 INRA expires , the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (" may sell ") price ( 231 cts ) or below the lower intervention (" may buy ") price ( 171 cts ) for six months .
If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides .
The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement .
Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage .
Similarly , if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300 , 000 tonnes have been made since the last revision , the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage .
Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15 - month intervals instead of 18 .
Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends .
As in the present accord the " may buy " and " may sell " levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price , and the " must buy " and " must sell " levels at 20 pct of it .
The lower and upper indicative prices ( floor and ceiling prices ) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents , unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months .
During the negotiations , consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , rose to 450 , 000 tonnes .
The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400 , 000 tonnes , with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150 , 000 tonnes .
Under the new accord , the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price .
At last Friday ' s session , Ahmed Farouk , speaking for producers , said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created .
Gerard Guillonneau of France , who spoke for consumers , agreed that the current agreement had worked " relatively well .
" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA , delegates noted that for nearly its whole life , the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the " must buy " level .
They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber .
In addition , provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated , ruling out speculation .
" It is a sort of middle - of - the - road agreement ," one delegate said .
The new pact will be open for signature at U . N . Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year .
To become operational , it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports .
Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now .
During the hiatus between the two agreements , the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place .
The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it .
TAIWAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS , CURRENCY BLAMED Taiwan ' s industrial production index , fell , largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar , by 8 . 18 pct to 140 . 06 ( base 1981 ) in February from a revised 152 . 53 in January , the Economy Ministry said .
It was the second consecutive monthly fall , after dropping nine pct in January , but it was still 26 . 49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year .
The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154 . 82 .
A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non - metal products , textiles and transportation equipment , and less mining and house construction .
The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar , which has made Taiwanese products more expensive .
He expected the decline to continue in the next few months because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the U . S . Currency .
The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the U . S . Dollar since September 1985 .
It closed at 34 . 40 to the U . S . Dollar today , and is expected to rise to about 32 to the dollar by the end of this year , foreign bankers and economists said .
NO ZIMBABWE DOLLAR DEVALUATION - CENTRAL BANK Zimbabwe ' s Reserve Bank , the nation ' s central bank , has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued .
Bank Governor Kombo Moyana told The Herald daily newspaper " unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar was about to occur " had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage .
" During February and the early part of March this ( speculation ) caused importers to bring forward their payments and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward remittance of export receipts , resulting in a significant slowdown in net foreign exchange inflows ," he added .
FORMER GOLD FIRM EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN JAPAN The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1 . 5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered , police said .
The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32 - year - old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June , 1985 .
Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano ' s home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet .
The company , established here in 1981 , undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors .
It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7 , 000 employees at its peak in early 1985 .
Toyota Shoji ' s business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30 , 000 clients , many of them pensioners and housewives , before the firm went bankrupt in July , 1985 , according to lawyers .
Of them , some 18 , 000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money , suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen , local press reports said .
Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa , 47 , former Toyota Shoji president , and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list .
They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1 . 5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm ' s bankruptcy , they said .
Today ' s arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police , who had questioned about 3 , 000 of the firm ' s former employees , police sources said .
WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia , the Third World ' s sixth largest debtor , to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues , western diplomats said .
Conable , who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo , will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers .
He said on arrival that the economy of South - East Asia ' s largest nation was being managed well , but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments .
Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank - funded projects in the eastern section of Java , Indonesia ' s most populous island .
He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow .
Indonesia , the only Asian member of OPEC , has been severely hit by last year ' s crash in oil prices , which cut its oil and gas revenues in half .
Japan ' s state Export - Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects .
Indonesia , a country of 168 mln people , has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending , devaluing its currency by 31 pct , and trying to boost exports , while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit .
Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change , particularly in dismantling Indonesia ' s high - cost protected economy .
" Oil prices , the debt crisis , the world recession , all call for major policy adjustments and external support ," Conable said in his arrival statement .
But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month , he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes .
" We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed ," Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport .
Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs , according to the Bank , which makes it the Third World ' s sixth biggest debtor .
It has received 10 . 7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968 .
Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see .
Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia , but implied it wanted more .
Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support , the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government ' s trade reform measures , and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer - term growth .
Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non - oil exports , liberalise trade and encourage outside investment .
Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia ' s 215 state - run companies could be sold .
But in a report last month , the U . S . Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms .
Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia ' s high - cost monopolies , which control core areas of the economy .
Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices .
It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation .
He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector .
Indonesia ' s current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2 . 64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1 , from an estimated 4 . 1 billion in 1986 / 87 .
NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA Nigeria ' s Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency , which has depreciated steadily .
The bank said in a statement that from April 2 , banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not , as presently , at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction .
This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower " marginal " rate , analysts said .
" It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered ," a Western diplomat commented .
The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions , known as the Second - Tier Foreign Exchange Market ( SFEM ), began last September 26 .
At last week ' s session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4 . 0 to the dollar , the third fall in a row .
" They were clearly worried ... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend ," the diplomat said .
The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly , not weekly , beginning on April 2 .
It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday ' s scheduled session would still take place , nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction .
Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply , encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira .
If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session , high demand could undermine the objective of the new system , analysts said .
Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered , the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid .
SFEM is a central part of Nigeria ' s structural adjustment program , which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa .
The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira , which was over - valued for many years , liberalising imports , boosting agriculture , removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy .
The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue - print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards .
Ishrat Husain , the World Bank ' s representative in Nigeria , said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions .
" So far so good " he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos , adding that only members of Nigeria ' s import - dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit .
Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect , he said .
Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira ' s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September .
NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured .
Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked .
" We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system ," he said .
" We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past .
Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all ," Moore said .
He added : " The cost of failure is beyond calculation .
It is our last hope and best opportunity this century .
We will not get another chance before the year 2000 .
" The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the " Uruguay round " talks last Sepember .
The meeting is also part of preparations for a full - scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Venice in June .
The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful , with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round .
The southerners ' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met .
The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected .
Moore said one aim was to " instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy .
" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits , as well as preventing " bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations .
" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community .
The delegates include U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter .
American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals : -- an end to agricultural subsidies ; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations ; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so - called intellectual property such as trademarks , patents and copyrights ; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT ' s 92 member states .
Earlier , New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons .
Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation .
AUSTRALIAN OFFER FOR SAN MIGUEL SHARES Diversified investment company , & lt ; Ariadne Australia Ltd >, has offered 3 . 8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm & lt ; San Miguel >, a Manila newspaper reported .
The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne ' s chairman , New Zealander Bruce Judge , that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation ' s yearly budget to buy the shares from the government .
The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report .
The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank ( UCPB ) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco , the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos .
The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares .
Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners .
The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week .
" Judge ' s offer of 3 . 8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines ' yearly budget ," Ariadne ' s Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday .
" Mr Judge ' s objective in this investment is to make his corporation ' s management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company ' s assets can be fully utilised .
" San Miguel , the country ' s largest brewer , is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines .
Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia , Britain , the U . S ., New Zealand and Hong Kong through & lt ; Barwon Farmlands Ltd >, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity .
Ariadne , with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover of about two billion , has interests also in mining , real estate and agricultural products .
INDONESIA PROTESTS AGAINST EC VEGETABLE OIL DUTY Indonesia has protested to the European Community ( EC ) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils , which will affect the country ' s palm oil exports to the EC , Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said .
" Indonesia , both individually and together with other members of the Association of South - East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ), has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports ," he told Indonesian reporters .
" We very much regret the community ' s plan ," he added .
He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made .
Indonesia is a major palm oil producer .
According to central bank figures , Indonesia exported 362 , 700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301 , 400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986 .
Complete 1986 figures are not yet available .
Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said recently that the increase in EC duties would add a new burden to ASEAN countries at a time when they were trying to strengthen their economies in the face of lower commodity prices .
ALITALIA SPA & lt ; AZPI . MI > CALENDAR 1986 Provisional net profit 55 billion lire vs 48 billion Turnover 3 , 750 billion vs 3 , 369 billion .
NOTE - Official results for Alitalia , Italy ' s national airline which is controlled by the state industrial holding company ( Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale - IRI ), are expected to be announced at an annual shareholders meeting in April .
RAIMOND EXPECTS EC - GULF PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED French Foreign Minister Jean - Bernard Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the European Community ( EC ).
Negotiations have been under way between the Community and the six - nation Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) for three years .
Raimond , due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ), told the semi - official daily Al - Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached .
" I am confident that problems between the two big partners , the GCC and the EC , will find a solution .
I will work to reach that solution ," he said in the interview conducted in Paris .
An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides .
GCC members Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , the UAE and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached .
Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved .
But added : " Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress .
" Referring to the Iran - Iraq war , he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties .
He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran .
Some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved .
He gave no details but said : " France wishes to have normal relations with Iran .

EXPLOSION AT BP OIL REFINERY IN SCOTLAND An explosion followed by a fire ripped through a British Petroleum ( BP ) oil refinery , killing one man .
A BP spokesman said the fire was confined to one plant at the 700 - acre refinery at Grangemouth , 25 miles west of Edinburgh .
The cause and extent of the damage had yet to be determined .
Two people were killed in a previous explosion and fire at the plant on March 13 .
That incident is still being investigated , the spokesman said .
AUSTRALIAN PLANS PHILIPPINE BRANCH FOR TAKEOVER The Australia based & lt ; Ariadne Australia Ltd >, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine brewing firm , & lt ; San Miguel Corp >, a Hong Kong newspaper said .
The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that & lt ; Barwon Farmlands Ltd >, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns a 30 pct stake , is planning a branch in the Philippines .
He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a total 3 . 8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares .
Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock .
But the Jacksons spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines .
He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut Planters Bank , which is believed to be linked with the country ' s deposed President Ferdinand Marcos .
He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only offer in cash , the newspaper reported .
Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that & lt ; Neptunia Corp >, a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel ' s president Andres Soriano , is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares .
The Philippine ' s Commission on Good Government ruled last May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel shares controlled by the brewery firm ' s former chairman Eduardo Cojuangco , who is also chairman of United Coconut .
Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm , adding San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties .
The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne ' s chairman , New Zealander Bruce Judge , that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation ' s yearly budget to buy the shares from the government .
" Judge ' s offer of 3 . 8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines ' yearly budget ," Ariadne ' s Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday .
Spokesmen of Ariadne , Jacksons and Neptunia were not available for comment , nor any officials of the Philippines .
& lt ; San Miguel Brewery Ltd >, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69 . 65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp , closed 40 cents higher at 15 . 50 H . K .
Dlrs on Friday .
ALITALIA REPORTS HIGHER NET PROFITS Italy ' s national airline , Alitalia Spa & lt ; AZPI . MI >, reporting a 14 . 6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net profit , said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic routes last year , but 11 . 5 pct fewer passengers on flights from North America and Canada .
Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism .
The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985 .
A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U . S .
In 1987 .
It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week , to reinstate flights to Boston and to re - open the direct Rome - Milan - Los Angeles service .
The spokesman announced that from March 29 , Alitalia would be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai .
For its summer 1987 programme , it would be adding 127 extra flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct .
RAFIDAIN BANK ' S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL The Jordan branch of Iraq ' s Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid - up capital to comply with the country ' s minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country .
Jordan ' s government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986 .
Rafidain ' s Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al - Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in .
The bank ' s 1986 balance shows paid - up capital of 3 . 1 mln dinars .
Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation , banking sources said .
Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital , while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash .
Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain ' s case , allowing it longer to comply .
They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad ' s financial difficulties .
The Jordan branch saw pre - tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550 , 332 dinars on assets of 12 . 6 mln dinars .
BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar .
Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday : " We don ' t have a target for the dollar .
" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar , saying : " We really don ' t talk about the dollar .
" He said protectionism was becoming " extremely strong " in the U . S .
In response to widening U . S . Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries .
" The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing .
It ' s extremely strong ," he said .
" As I ' ve said before , we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world ' s free trading system , because if the largest market in the world ( the U . S .) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s ," he said .
While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism , it alone did not offer any solution , he said .
" You must address this problem on the exchange rate side , but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone .
It ' s far more comprehensive and broad than that , and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach ," Baker said in the interview .
Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards , as well as remove their barriers to U . S . Imports .
But he did not elaborate or name any countries .
U . S . CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI - REFUNDING A hefty slice of new U . S . Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market , but at least this week ' s offerings should provide it with some focus , economists said .
" Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work , so the auctions should breathe some life into the market ," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc .
The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two - year , four - year and seven - year notes on the sales block this week .
The " mini - refunding ," which will raise 9 . 27 billion dlrs in new cash , comprises 10 billion dlrs of two - year notes for auction on Tuesday , 7 . 75 billion dlrs of four - year notes on Wednesday and 7 . 25 billion dlrs of seven - year notes on Thursday .
The market also faces the regular weekly three - and six - month bill auction today , amounting to 12 . 8 billion dlrs .
The mini - refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market .
Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U . S . Economic outlook , diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar .
Moreover , the bond market ' s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high - yield markets overseas , like the U . K ., As well as in U . S . Equities .
But according to the Merrill Lynch economists , there are signs the pall hanging over the U . S .
Bond market is lifting a bit .
" Customer activity has been light , but all on the buy - side , and there is a marked absence of selling ," they said in a weekly report .
Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two - and four - year issues at this week ' s sales .
" The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings .
Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider , it is still positive ," he said in a weekly market review .
But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move .
This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run .
" Based on last week ' s events , there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane ," said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc .
Indeed , talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re - weight their portfolios in favour of the higher - yielding markets at the start of Japan ' s new fiscal year on April 1 .
And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter - dated issues on offer at this week ' s U . S . Auctions , such reports undermine market confidence .
Even actions by the British , Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets , the Salomon Brothers ' economists said .
Meanwhile , ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U . S . Market unless they deviate widely from expectations , economists said .
This week ' s economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders .
Economists expect a rebound from January ' s depressed levels .
Peter Greenbaum of Smith , Barney , Harris Upham and Co said several areas , including transport equipment , should have bounced back .
But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders .
He forecasts a rise of two pct after January ' s 6 . 7 pct slump .
Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct .
Friday ' s consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0 . 3 pct after a 0 . 7 pct January gain .
Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month , while food prices declined .
Meanwhile , economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter - end and the mid - April tax date .
Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday .
Fed funds traded at 6 - 1 / 16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level .
N . Y . BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 64 MLN DLRS The eight major New York City banks had 64 mln dlrs in average borrowings from the Federal Reserve in the week to Wednesday February 25 , a Fed spokesman said .
The week marked the second half of the two - week bank statement period that ended on Wednesday .
The banks had no borrowings in the prior week .
Commenting on the latest week , a Fed spokesman said that all of the borrowing occurred yesterday and was done by fewer than half of the banks .
National data on discount window borrowings are due to be released at 1630 EST ( 2130 GMT ).
SANTOS BIDS FOR OIL AND GAS COMPANY TMOC RESOURCES Cooper Basin oil producer Santos Ltd & lt ; STOS . S > said it will bid 4 . 00 dlrs a share for the 96 . 03 pct it does not already hold in diversified oil and gas company & lt ; TMOC Resources Ltd >.
Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248 . 5 mln dlrs .
It said it already holds 1 . 91 mln of TMOC ' s 25 cent par shares .
TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin , the company said in a statement .
Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production , exploration and pipeline interests .
In the Northern Territory it has a 43 . 75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of & lt ; N . T .
Gas Pty Ltd >, owner and operator of the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline .
In Queensland , TMOC has extensive interests in the Surat Basin , including the 100 pct owned and operated Moonie oil field and 33 pct of the Boxleigh gas field .
TMOC owns 80 pct of the & lt ; Moonie Pipeline Co Pty Ltd > which owns and operates the Moonie to Brisbane oil pipeline .
TMOC also holds 25 pct of the Jackson to Moonie oil pipeline , 20 pct owned by Santos .
Output from the Naccowlah block , 40 pct owned by Santos , provides the bulk of the throughput of both pipelines .
TMOC has exploration interests in a number of areas in the Amadeus , Surat , Eromanga and Canning basins .
It also has oil and gas interests in Britain ' s North Sea , Ecuador , and the U . S ., Along with gold and base metal production through its associate & lt ; Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc >, Santos said .
GATT SUCCESS WILL TAKE PRESSURE , N . Z .
MINISTER Long term pressure by trade ministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ) is to succeed , New Zealand ' s Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said .
Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22 nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers " need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be faced and resolved .
" Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such international gatherings , which includes the OECD ministerial meeting in May and the G - 7 meeting in Venice in June , enabling ministers to maintain contact .
World trade conditions are getting better not worse , he said .
He said New Zealand is " moving rapidly and of our own initiative in the direction of liberalisation , and I warn you we shall be looking for partners .

JAPAN LONG - TERM PRIME SEEN CUT TO RECORD LOW SOON Japan ' s long - term banks will soon cut their prime rate , now at a record low 5 . 5 pct , by 0 . 2 or 0 . 3 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five - year debentures , long - term bankers said .
The long - term prime rate is customarily set 0 . 9 percentage point above the coupon on five - year bank debentures issued by the long - term banks every month .
The latest bank debentures , at 4 . 6 pct , have met strong end - investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates , dealers said .
The current 5 . 5 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28 .
COFFEE CONFERENCE ENDS WITH CALL TO CONTINUE TALKS A meeting of eight Latin American coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices .
A statement delivered by the conference ' s president , Nicaragua ' s External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca , said the object of future meetings would be to seek negotiations leading to basic export quotas .
The meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil , Mexico , Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Costa Rica and Nicaragua .
A Panamanian representative attended the meeting as an observer .
Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which could be presented to the International Coffee Organization .
In opening the meeting , Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind falling coffee prices , which he said have caused billions of dollars in losses to countries in the region .
Jorio Dauster , president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , said his government is committed to working towards an producers accord in order to bring about higher prices .
YEUTTER SEES U . S ., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade , especially over semiconductors , Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U . S . Super - computers , and barriers to U . S . Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project , U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said .
He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two - day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) talks .
European Community ( EC ) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world ' s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC , the U . S . And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT .
Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes .
New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked .
The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts .
Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years .
" Countries don ' t get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is , maybe , five or six years in the future .
" He also said he did not consider the new U . S . Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago .
" That ' s a very healthy development ," he added .
" If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist .
" " Members of Congress , that is the contemplative members of Congress , have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit ," Yeutter said .
" They ' ve also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and , in my judgement , more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago .
" He added , " Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter .

NEW COOPER BASIN GAS POOL DISCOVERY REPORTED & lt ; Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd > said a second gas flow has been recorded in the Epsilon formation of the Toolachee Block on PEL five and six signifying a new pool discovery .
The Kerna Four appraisal well flowed gas at 235 , 038 cubic meters a day with four kiloliters of condensate through a 13mm surface choke over an interval of 2 , 374 to 2 , 399 meters .
DST 1 , in the Epsilon formation , was earlier reported as flowing gas at 237 , 862 cm / day , Delhi said in a statement .
The well is two km south south east of Kerna 3 , 15 km south east of the Dullingari field and 75 km east of Moomba .
Delhi said the remaining objective of the well is the Patchawarra formation .
Other interest holders in the Kerna Four well are : Santos Ltd & lt ; STOS . S > 50 pct , Delhi 30 , & lt ; Vamgas Ltd > 10 , & lt ; South Australian Oil and Gas Corp Pty Ltd > 10 pct .
IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless , and warned the U . S . And other countries not to interfere in the region .
Tehran radio , monitored by the BBC , quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by " a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world .
" U . S . Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger , in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast , said the U . S . Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti - ship missiles in the Gulf .
The U . S . State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U . S . Concern that Iranian anti - ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf .
U . S . Officials have said Iran has new Chinese - made anti - ship " Silkworm " missiles , which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before .
The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were " misleading propaganda .
" He said Iraq ' s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use " all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension .
" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U . S . " We are fully prepared to do what ' s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway .
" " We aren ' t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen , but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area ," he said .
Weinberger said U . S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual .
A U . S . Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea .
The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U . S . Was trying to build up its military presence in the region .
MFS MANAGED MUNCIPAL BOND TRUST SETS PAYOUT & lt ; MFS Managed Muncipal Trust Bond > said it declared a monthly payout income distribution of 5 . 7 cts a share compared with 5 . 6 cts for the previous month .
It said the distribution is payable March 20 to shareholders of record March two .
MALAYSIAN 1987 ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN ABOVE FORECAST The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd ( DBS ) said Malaysia ' s real gross domestic product growth ( gdp ) in 1987 could be 1 . 5 to two pct , above a budget target of one pct .
It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves , the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future .
The report was presented at a two - day investment conference organised by the DBS , one of Singapore ' s four major banks .
The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy .
It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2 . 60 and 2 . 70 Malaysian dlrs to the U . S . Dollar for the rest of the year .
But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia ' s external debt remains worrying and should be controlled .
It said Malaysia ' s external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct .
PHILIPPINE COCONUT PRODUCT EXPORTS FALL IN JANUARY Coconut product exports fell to 163 , 924 copra tonnes in January from 196 , 610 tonnes in December and 167 , 747 tonnes in January last year , government figures show .
Coconut product sales earned 44 . 54 mln dlrs compared with 45 . 30 mln in December and 49 . 09 mln a year earlier .
GERMAN STEEL SUBSIDIES CANNOT CONTINUE - MINISTER Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said the state could not continue to pour money into West Germany ' s ailing steel and coal industries because the subsidies endangered other parts of the economy .
" The situation is completely absurd from an economic point of view ," Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interview released ahead of publication tomorrow .
" We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel to an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge burden on all other branches of industry and making them uncompetitive ," he said .
Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longer capable of being competitive .
Continued state subsidies would not save them but would only prolong their lives artifically for a few years , he said .
" That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them in the way that we have done in the past ," he said .
Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce their workforces , citing weak prices and lower exports due to the strength of the mark and tough foreign competition .
Bangemann said everything possible would be done to find new jobs for the workers affected by the cuts .
DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS & lt ; SGL > BID & lt ; Dart Group Corp > said it told Supermarkets General Corp & lt ; SGL > it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company .
Dart has said it would offer 41 . 75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders .
SGL has termed the 1 . 62 billion dlr offer unsolicited .
In a letter to SGL dated March 20 , Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders .
SGL officials could not be reached for comment .
Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers , but not itself .
These purchasers would also be given access to SGL ' s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees .
" We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms ," said a source close to Dart .
Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout .
Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer .
Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer .
It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL , but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL ' s approval .
The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares , Dart said .
It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction , it said .
Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares .
Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives , but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement .
It said it indicated it was flexible on price , but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal , Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package .
It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5 . 7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman , executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine .
Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers ' severance agreements , although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition .
Dart said under their present agreements , none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments .
Also , Dart said Lieberman , Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2 . 6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes .
It also said top management ' s incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company ' s compensation committee .
Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management ' s supplemental retirement plan .
Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management , estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company ' s present policy .
Dart said despite such management payments , it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL .
Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres .
Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder , seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence .
The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty .
Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive .
AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES The government ' s over - reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia ' s economic performance , Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) chairman Dennis Benbow said .
Over one - third of Australia ' s indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices , he told the APEA annual conference here .
This dependence on oil - generated revenue distorts the country ' s economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs , he said .
Australia ' s medium - term liquid fuel self - sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat , yet the government ' s response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry , Benbow said .
Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in fiscal 1992 / 93 from 546 , 000 bpd in 1985 / 86 , reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields , he said .
Bass Strait reserves are now two - thirds depleted , with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted , he said .
By 1992 / 93 , Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985 / 86 level , assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead , Benbow said .
Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40 , 000 to 130 , 000 bpd , he said .
Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680 , 000 bpd in 1992 / 93 from 565 , 000 in 1985 / 86 , implying a crude oil gap of between 270 , 000 and 360 , 000 bpd in five years time , he said .
At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar , annual oil imports in 1992 / 93 would cost between 3 . 2 billion and 3 . 6 billion dlrs , Benbow said .
Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980 ' s , the addition to reserves has been inadequate , he said .
For example , the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980 - 84 represent about two years ' consumption , he said .
He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration .
MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE Singapore will have an inflation rate of one pct in 1987 , up from a negative 1 . 4 pct in 1986 , Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament .
He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate , the first fall in a decade , was due largely to lower world prices for oil and oil - related items .
But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be repeated this year because of projected higher prices for primary commodities and oil .

ARIADNE UNIT CONFIRMS BID FOR SAN MIGUEL Ariadne group unit & lt ; Barwon Farmlands Ltd > confirmed it offered 3 . 8 billion pesos in cash for the 38 mln shares of Philippine brewing company & lt ; San Miguel Corp >.
The Australia - based Barwon , 30 pct owned by New Zealander Bruce Judge ' s Ariadne group , said in a statement released in Hong Kong that a formal offer had been made to the Philippines government , which holds the shares .
It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed favourably .
Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend that an offer had been made .
Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker & lt ; Jacksons Ltd >, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38 . 1 mln A and B shares of San Miguel .
The Philippine government seized the shares , which represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm , from the & lt ; United Coconut Planters Bank >, alleged by the government to be linked with the country ' s deposed President Ferdinand Marcos .
The Barwon statement said a deal is expected to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippines government in 14 days .
Barwon also said it made recommendations to the government on how it could purchase the class A shares , which can only be held by a Philippine national or a firm which is at least 60 pct held by a member of the country .
It did not elaborate .
The Hong Kong Economical Journal quoted a spokesman of Jacksons as saying Barwon plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to meet the criteria .

EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non - Middle East supplies diminish , Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > director and senior vice - president Donald McIvor said .
Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East , he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) annual conference .
It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact , he said .
McIvor said 37 of the world ' s 30 , 000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered .
Only 11 of these 37 super - giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years , three of them in the Middle East , he said .
He also said that since 1970 , the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year .
More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East , he said .
McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability .
" It is important to enhance the likelihood of home - country discoveries with measures such as non - discriminatory and stable taxation , and minimum regulation , together with opening up of acreage for exploration ," he said .
Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum , he added .
TAIWAN TO BOOST FARM IMPORTS FROM U . S ., EUROPE Taiwan is expected to boost agricultural imports from the U . S . And Europe in calendar 1987 to help balance trade , the Council of Agriculture said .
A council official , who declined to be named , told Reuters the imports , which will include about seven mln tonnes of oilseeds , grains and dairy products , would be worth some four billion U . S . Dlrs against 3 . 72 billion in 1986 and 3 . 38 billion in 1985 .
Taiwan ' s surplus with the U . S . Rose to 13 . 6 billion dlrs last year from 10 . 2 billion in 1985 , government figures show .
Government figures also show Taiwan ' s surplus with Europe rose to 1 . 53 billion dlrs last year from 543 mln in 1985 .
Taiwan ' s imports of U . S . Farm produce last year amounted to 1 . 41 billion dlrs against 1 . 52 billion in 1985 .
Imports from Europe rose to 182 mln U . S . Dlrs from 148 mln , the official said .
He attributed the decline in the value of U . S . Imports to falling agricultural products prices last year .
AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government ' s maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output , resources analyst Ian Story said here .
A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420 , 000 barrels per day ( BPD ) for the next year rather than falling to 380 , 000 BPD in 1987 / 88 , he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference .
Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd .
Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate , Story said .
The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S >/ Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > partnership to shut - in production , accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue , he said .
He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2 . 07 dlrs from 0 . 80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct .
" The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs ," Story said .
Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self - sufficiency , increase government revenue , boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development , he said .
The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure .
GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF Debt among African countries will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates , Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said .
He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries .
Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo .
" I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries ," Mamman said .
" The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries .
" Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35 . 3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth ( GDP ) rate of three to four pct by 1990 .
Yet at the same time Africa ' s debt service was estimated at 24 . 5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990 .
" With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists ," Mamman said .
Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness , he said .
" The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports ," he added .
GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates , as seen in last month ' s Paris pact , extend to keeping down European interest rates , banking economists said .
But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany ' s economy , they said .
The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention , economists said .
Economists speculated that G - 7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U . S . and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April .
" The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant .
They mark an uncoupling of movements in U . S . and foreign interest rates ," Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study .
It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar ' s fall .
These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized .
West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U . S . not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point , to avoid weakening the dollar .
West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline .
" It ' s not a taboo ," Peter Pietsch , spokesman for Commerzbank AG said .
But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year , as re - emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year .
The Bundesbank ' s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year ' s low .
Last week , yields fell to around 5 . 50 pct , not far from the 1986 low of 5 . 35 pct posted in mid - April .
Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer - term paper .
Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long - term rates , which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate .
It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates , as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank ' s central bank money stock aggregate .
But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts , part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U . S . demands for faster West German growth .
This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing .
This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak , but demand could emerge if rates begin rising .
Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources , including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth , and higher than expected spending .
Josef Koerner , chief economist of the West German Ifo - Institut , said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November .
Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up .
But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar ' s decline , long term yields may to have to rise , economists said .
Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn ' s tax reform package .
The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5 . 2 billion marks to 14 . 4 billion .
West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable .
Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform , such as raising indirect taxes .
But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing .
The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits .
The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21 . 9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14 . 8 billion in fourth quarter 1985 .
The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures , and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year , when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter .
PHILIPPINES POSTS 68 MLN DLR JANUARY TRADE DEFICIT The Philippines posted a trade deficit of 68 mln dlrs in January , compared with deficits of 57 mln in January 1986 and 28 mln in December , government figures show .

JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy .
Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting that , in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September , a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987 / 88 budget is approved .
Hata , speaking at the first session of the two - day meeting , said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy , but did not elaborate .
Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever , reflecting financial deficits , payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries .
Despite great potential , developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties , particularly debt , he added .
The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este , Uruguay , and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva .
" It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled ," Hata said .
Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others .
In order to rebuild the free trade system , it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end .
As part of its contribution , Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan ' s domestic market more open to developing countries , he said .

U . K . MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today .
Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take - up of treasury bills will drain around 1 . 18 billion stg while bankers balances below target will take out some 20 mln stg .
Partly offseting these outflows , a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to the system respectively .
INDONESIA ' S NON - OIL EXPORTS DECLINE IN 1986 Indonesia ' s non - oil and gas exports fell to 5 . 79 billion dlrs in calendar 1986 from 5 . 98 billion in 1985 , according to Bank Indonesia figures .
Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985 , but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to 180 . 6 mln from 246 mln , weekly central bank figures show .
Indonesia hopes to boost its non - oil exports to make up for oil revenue lost because of lower prices .
But the lower value of commodities such as timber , rubber , palm oil and tea on world markets has prevented this , despite a 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah against the dollar in September .
AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SAYS AGRICULTURE GATT PRIORITY Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis .
In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries .
He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem .
" We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD ( Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform ," Dawkins said .
The Venice summit is scheduled for June .
He said Australia ' s interests in the Uruguay Round , the eighth under the GATT , are wide ranging .
Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system .
Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este , Uruguay , have made a reasonable start , but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes .
" We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice .
" The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years , he said .
JAPAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING 3 . 6 PCT IN 1987 / 88 Japan is expected to post a 3 . 6 pct rise in real gross national product in 1987 / 88 , higher than the official 3 . 5 pct target , a private economic institute said .
The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April - June quarter , partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries .
The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar .
It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year .
The institute forecast that Japan ' s exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar ' s fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U . S . Economy .
Japan ' s trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 90 . 2 billion dlrs in 1987 / 88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year , it said .

PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR VEGETABLE OIL LEVY Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community ( EC ) imposed a levy on vegetable oils .
Concepcion , speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) here , said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less - developed nations should not be disrupted .
He said the EC not only ignored Manila ' s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries .
Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers , he noted that " I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value .
" He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices , but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services .
" The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed ," he said .
BURMA SAYS DEBT SERVICE RATIO FALLS TO 48 . 8 PCT Burma ' s debt service ratio will have fallen to 48 . 8 pct in the fiscal year to end - March 1987 from 50 pct in 1985 - 1986 , the official Council of People ' s Inspectors ( CPI ) reported .
Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above 70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign exchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks ' imports .
The CPI , which oversees government spending , said in its latest report to parliament that foreign currency reserves fell to a record low of 407 . 9 mln kyats in September 1986 from 430 . 3 mln in March 1986 .
Earlier figures were not available .
Debt servicing cost Burma 1 . 62 billion kyats in 1985 - 1986 while foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans and aid -- totalled 3 . 23 billion kyats in the same period , the council said .
Later figures were not available .
Burma , which diplomats here say now has foreign debts of up to 3 . 4 billion dlrs , has applied to the United Nations to be reclassified as one of the world ' s least developed countries in order to qualify for softer loan and grant aid .
INDIA BOUGHT 24 , 000 TONNES OF RBD OLEIN AT TENDER The Indian State Trading Corporation ( STC ) bought four cargoes of rbd palm olein totalling 24 , 000 tonnes at its vegetable oil import tender last week , traders said .

The business comprised three 6 , 000 tonne cargoes for June at 346 dlrs and 6 , 000 tonnes for July at 340 dlrs per tonne cif .
It also secured a 20 , 000 tonne cargo of optional origin rapeseed oil for May 15 / Jun 15 shipment at 321 dlrs cif .

BP GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY SHUT , HYDROCRACKER DAMAGED The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site , a refinery spokesman said .
He said the rest of the 178 , 500 bpd refinery , including the 19 , 000 bpd catalytic cracker , was undamaged .
The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days , he said .
But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32 , 000 bpd hydrocracker , which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline , and it will be out of operation for some months .
The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources .
BP has a 437 , 000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam , a 181 , 900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt , West Germany , a 181 , 900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant .
He said the explosion and fire , in which one worker was killed , occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation .
The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited , he said .
This work was scheduled to be completed by mid - April , but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident .
Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13 , but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident .
DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS , PAPER SAYS China ' s top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain , Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said .
Customs figures show that China imported 7 . 73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 , up from 5 . 97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16 . 15 mln in 1982 .
The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy .
It did not give the context of his remarks .
The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln , up from 391 mln in 1986 .
The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where " pigs are not fed , there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed .
" " We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000 ," he said .
" We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain .
" The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains , including corn and rice , unchanged since 1978 , but it gave no details .

BANGLADESH FORECASTS GDP GROWTH OF 4 . 4 PCT Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4 . 4 pct in the year ending June 30 , Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters .
Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from 17 pct in 1981 / 82 , he said last night .
The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986 / 87 .
Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981 / 82 .

BEGHIN - SAY INCREASES CAPITAL TO FINANCE EXPANSION French sugar group Beghin - Say , which is 49 . 6 pct owned by Italy ' s Gruppo Ferruzzi , is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three - for - one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion , president Jean - Marc Vernes told analysts .
For the first stage Beghin - Say will issue some 2 . 05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs .
The share currently trades at 734 francs .
Then 658 , 000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs , raising capital to 703 mln francs .
The capital increase will bring the group around 1 . 2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans .
These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France , Vernes said .
Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products ' installations in Europe .
Apart from the French plant , these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany , two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark .
Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations , and Beghin - Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs , Vernes said .
If this bid fails , Beghin - Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants , either in the maize or wheat starch sector .
Beghin - Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary , another major reason for its capital increase .
Kaysersberg , which was transformed from a division of Beghin - Say into a fully - fledged chemical subsidiary last year , has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords , Vernes said .
He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future .

BANK OF FRANCE SAYS NO MONEY MARKET TENDER TODAY The Bank of France will not hold a money market intervention tender today , ruling out a further cut in its 7 - 3 / 4 pct intervention rate , central bank sources said .
At the tenders , depending on market conditions , the Bank injects liquidity into the market by buying up first category paper .
But market sources said that while the recent franc performance leaves room for a further quarter point cut in the intervention rate there was plenty of market liquidity .
The Bank cut its rate to 7 - 3 / 4 pct from eight pct on March 9 , the first change since January 2 .
Interest rates also fell the same week in Britain , Belgium and Italy .

BALLADUR SEES ONLY TWO PCT FRENCH GROWTH IN 1987 French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct , the same as last year , due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected , Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying .
Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2 . 5 pct this year , against an original target of 2 . 8 pct .
Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) estimate of 2 . 1 pct growth , the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports , Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos .
Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year , compared with an initial 1986 target of 2 . 5 pct and 1 . 1 pct growth in 1985 .
He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year ' s figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985 .
He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989 .
FRENCH GDP SHOULD RISE 2 . 3 PCT IN 1988 - MINISTRY French gross domestic product should grow by 2 . 3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2 . 1 pct in 1986 , the Finance Ministry said .
The latest forecast , prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission , assumed an exchange rate of 6 . 20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18 . 9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17 . 4 dlrs this year and 14 . 7 in 1986 .
The Commission , headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur , forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year - on - year at end - 1988 from 2 . 4 pct at end 1987 and 2 . 1 pct last year .
In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2 . 5 pct this year and 2 . 7 pct last year , it said .
Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year ' s 0 . 5 billion surplus , it added .
Employment should rise by 0 . 1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2 . 2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2 . 6 pct this year and 2 . 9 pct in 1986 .
Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1 . 8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power , up from 1 . 1 pct this year but less than last year ' s 2 . 9 pct , and a 1 . 6 pct rise in household consumption , compared with this year ' s 1 . 5 pct and last year ' s 2 . 9 pct .
Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3 . 7 pct last year , with private sector productive investment rising 4 . 9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5 . 5 pct in 1986 .
The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget , which the government is now preparing for presentation in September .
DANISH TRADE IN BALANCE IN FEBRUARY Denmark ' s balance of payments on current account was provisionally put at zero in February , against a 181 mln crown surplus in January and a 1 . 5 billion deficit in February 1986 , the National Statistics Office said .
Exports rose to 13 . 94 billion crowns in February from 12 . 53 billion in January , against 14 . 16 billion in February last year .
February imports rose to 13 . 94 billion from 12 . 35 billion in January , against 15 . 67 billion in February 1986 .
The February figure provisionally gives a trade surplus for 1987 of 180 mln crowns , against a 3 . 04 billion deficit in the same 1986 period .
BEGHIN - SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies , Jean - Marc Vernes , president of French sugar producer Beghin - Say , which is leading the protest , told journalists today .
" Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution ," he said , adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention .
Vernes said that the protest , involving 770 , 000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone , was prompted by the EC ' s policy since mid - 1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention .
At last week ' s tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1 . 3 European currency units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed , compared with the previous week ' s rebate which was 2 . 5 Ecus below the necessary level .
Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take , but he reaffirmed the long - term desire of producers to export to the world market , providing they were not losing money by doing so .
Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1 , when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores , or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date .
The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers .

The coincident indicator , designed to signal current turning points in the economy , was put at 91 . 2 in January , down from 91 . 9 in December and 91 . 6 in january 1986 .
The lagging index , which the CSO says shows a turning point in the economy about a year after it happens , was at 92 . 4 in January , down from 92 . 5 in December and 93 . 0 a year earlier .
The Office said leading indicators still do not show a consistent picture of the likely future developments of the business cycle in Britain .
It said the strong rise in the longer leading index between December and February was due mainly to rises in share prices .
AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL , FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10 . 40 mln hectares in 1987 / 88 from 11 . 72 mln sown in 1986 / 87 , Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd ( AWF ) said in its first preliminary crop forecast .
But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987 / 88 would be less than the 16 . 5 mln tonnes of last year , the private forecaster said , as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season .
Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks , it said .
The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost , credit and yield pressures .
But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average , AWF said .
Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct , AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops .
" The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds , pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers ' income ," AWF said .
AWF ' s state area forecasts in mln hectares , with 1986 / 87 production in mln tonnes , are as follows ( crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year ) Area Crop 1987 / 88 1986 / 87 1986 / 87 Queensland 0 . 82 0 . 82 0 . 95 N . S . W .

JAPAN LONG - TERM PRIME SEEN CUT TO RECORD LOW SOON Japan ' s long - term banks will soon cut their prime rate , now at a record low 5 . 5 pct , by 0 . 2 or 0 . 3 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five - year debentures , long - term bankers said .
The long - term prime rate is customarily set 0 . 9 percentage point above the coupon on five - year bank debentures issued by the long - term banks every month .
The latest bank debentures , at 4 . 6 pct , have met strong end - investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates , dealers said .
The current 5 . 5 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28 .
YEUTTER SEES U . S ., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade , especially over semiconductors , Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U . S . Super - computers , and barriers to U . S . Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project , U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said .
He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two - day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) talks .
European Community ( EC ) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world ' s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC , the U . S . And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT .
Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes .
New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked .
The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts .
Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years .
" Countries don ' t get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is , maybe , five or six years in the future .
" He also said he did not consider the new U . S . Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago .
" That ' s a very healthy development ," he added .
" If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist .
" " Members of Congress , that is the contemplative members of Congress , have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit ," Yeutter said .
" They ' ve also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and , in my judgement , more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago .
" He added , " Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter .

IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless , and warned the U . S . And other countries not to interfere in the region .
Tehran radio , monitored by the BBC , quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by " a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world .
" U . S . Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger , in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast , said the U . S . Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti - ship missiles in the Gulf .
The U . S . State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U . S . Concern that Iranian anti - ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf .
U . S . Officials have said Iran has new Chinese - made anti - ship " Silkworm " missiles , which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before .
The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were " misleading propaganda .
" He said Iraq ' s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use " all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension .
" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U . S . " We are fully prepared to do what ' s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway .
" " We aren ' t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen , but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area ," he said .
Weinberger said U . S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual .
A U . S . Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea .
The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U . S . Was trying to build up its military presence in the region .
BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar .
Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday : " We don ' t have a target for the dollar .
" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar , saying : " We really don ' t talk about the dollar .
" He said protectionism was becoming " extremely strong " in the U . S .
In response to widening U . S . Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries .
" The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing .
It ' s extremely strong ," he said .
" As I ' ve said before , we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world ' s free trading system , because if the largest market in the world ( the U . S .) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s ," he said .
While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism , it alone did not offer any solution , he said .
" You must address this problem on the exchange rate side , but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone .
It ' s far more comprehensive and broad than that , and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach ," Baker said in the interview .
Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards , as well as remove their barriers to U . S . Imports .
But he did not elaborate or name any countries .
FRENCH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY French industrial production fell a seasonally adjusted 1 . 98 pct in January after revised unchanged output in December , the National Statistics Institute ( INSEE ) said .
The figure , which excludes construction and public works , put the January index , base 1980 , at 99 after 101 in December .
January output was 1 . 98 pct down on January 1986 .
INSEE , which from January changed its base year to 1980 from 1970 , originally had December output down 2 . 2 pct on November , using the old base year .
INSEE said production in January was affected by rail strikes and severely cold weather .
It said output of gas and electricity was very high but activity slowed on construction sites , in quarries and in certain base industries .
GOOD DEMAND FOR COLOMBIANS ON BREMEN MARKET The Bremen green coffee market attracted good buying interest for Colombian coffee last week , while Brazils were almost neglected , trade sources said .

NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured .
Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked .
" We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system ," he said .
" We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past .
Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all ," Moore said .
" The cost of failure is beyond calculation .
It is our last hope and best opportunity this century .
We will not get another chance before the year 2000 ," he added .
The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the " Uruguay round " talks last September .
The talks are also part of preparations for a full - scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Venice .
The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful , with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round .
The southerners ' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met .
The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected .
Moore said one aim was to " instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy .
" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits , as well as preventing " bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations .
" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community .
The delegates include U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter .
American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals : -- an end to agricultural subsidies ; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations ; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so - called intellectual property such as trademarks , patents and copyrights ; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT ' s 92 member states .
Earlier , New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons .
Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation .

CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD Uganda ' s state - run Coffee Marketing Board ( CMB ) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments , trade sources said .
The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings ( the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs ) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered , but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure , they said .
The board ' s cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole , since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda ' s total exports .
The CMB ' s financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail - freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa , Dar es Salaam and Tanga .
These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems , the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana - Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports .
Sebaana - Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks .
However , an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15 , causing fresh delays in cargo movements .
Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs .
Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750 , 000 bags .
These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda ' s expected three mln 60 - kilo bag 1986 / 87 ( October - September ) crop , the sources said .
According to the sources , the board ' s financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts .
The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers , whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process , they said .
The sources said the CMB ' s price structure had been overtaken by Uganda ' s high inflation rate , unofficially estimated at about 200 pct , and that this was a further disincentive to producers , already owed large arrears .
" The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind , the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic , and the sooner the so - called economic package is put in top gear , the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole ," one of the sources said .
The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda ' s economic recovery after 15 years of political strife .
GENERAL PARTNERS IN GENCORP & lt ; GY > PROXY FIGHT General Partners , the group tendering for all GenCorp Inc shares at 100 dlrs each , said it has started soliciting proxies against GenCorp ' s proposals to increase its number of authorized shares outstanding , create a board with staggered election dates and eliminate cumulative voting .
The proposals are to be voted on at the March 31 annual meeting .
General Partners , a partnership of privately - held & lt ; Wagner and Brown > and AFG Industries Inc & lt ; AFG >, made the disclosure in a newspaper advertisement .
The partnership has already filed suit in U . S . District Court in Columbus , Ohio , seeking to block a vote on the proposals and to invalidate GenCorp ' s defensive preferred share purchase rights .
General Partners asked shareholders to either vote against the proposals or abstain from voting on them .
USAIR & lt ; U > CUTS PIEDMONT & lt ; PIE > SHARES SOUGHT USAir Group Inc said it has amended its 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont Aviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to 9 , 309 , 394 .
Previously it had sought all shares .
In a newspaper advertisement , USAir said the offer and withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire April 3 , along with the new proration period .
On Friday , the U . S . Department of Transportation approved USAir ' s acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont .
If USAir were to acquire more than 51 pct in the tender , it would be required to sell the excess within one week .
USAir said receipt of the 9 , 309 , 394 shares -- which is also the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50 . 1 pct on a fully diluted basis .
The company said even if the purchase of the 9 , 309 , 394 Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit , USAir would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir ' s application to gain control of Piedmont , subject to the order not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way .
NEW RUBBER PACT ADOPTED AT GENEVA CONFERENCE Producers and consumers representing most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years .
Negotiations for a new INRA , to succeed the present one which runs out next October , began nearly two years ago .
Agreement on the new five - year pact , which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall , was reached at a two - week session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ).
STUDY SAYS OIL PRICE FALL SPURS BANKRUPTCIES The sharp drop in world oil prices the past year triggered a 60 pct increase in bankruptcies in the country ' s oil states , according to a study released by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ).
API said the Dunn and Bradstreet study found that business failures rose nationally by 6 . 9 pct in 1986 over 1985 , but in the " oil patch " of the Southwest the increase was 59 . 9 pct .
It said bankruptcies in Texas were up 57 . 4 pct , Oklahoma , 55 . 9 pct , Colorado , 55 . 8 pct and Louisiana , 46 . 6 pct .
In Alaska , failures rose by 66 . 2 per cent , it said .
API also said that three of the states with the highest number of bank failures last year were large oil and gas producers - Texas , Oklahoma and Kansas .
WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE The world ' s dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it , Donald K . McIvor , an Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview .
" Non - OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable ," McIvor said .
Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence , McIvor said .
McIvor , Exxon ' s senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast ' s large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding .
" Since 1970 we ' ve been consuming oil at rates of 20 - 25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10 - 15 bilion barrels per year ," McIvor said .
" The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity ," he added .
McIvor said that of the some 30 , 000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 " one - one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered .
" McIvor said , in response to a question , that he did not believe there were any more " super giants ", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels , to be found which would change the conclusion of the world ' s growing dependency .
" Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East .
Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east ( Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska ' s North Slope ).
" McIvor said .
McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U . S . like Alaska ' s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline .
But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east , particulartly in Canada , the North Sea , and Australia and Africa .
McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies .
" The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies ," McIvor said .
McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy .
Asked about the options offered this week by U . S . Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U . S . production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but " the thrust of his ( Herrington ) report is valid .
It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U . S .
production .
" McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs .
" Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd ' s energy supply ," McIvor said .
" Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat , as an industrial fuel ," he added .
S . AFRICAN CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION RISES SLIGHTLY South African year - on - year consumer price inflation rose slightly to 16 . 3 pct in February after falling sharply to 16 . 1 pct in January from 18 . 1 pct in December , Central Statistics Office figures show .
The monthly rise in the all items index ( base 1980 ) was 1 . 09 pct to 251 . 0 in February after a 1 . 4 pct increase to 248 . 3 in January .
A year ago the index stood at 215 . 8 and year on year consumer price inflation at 18 . 05 pct .
FINLAND FEBRUARY TRADE SURPLUS AT 641 MLN MARKKA Finland had a 641 mln markka trade surplus in February following an 80 mln markka surplus in January and a 614 mln surplus in February 1986 , Customs Board preliminary figures showed .
Exports in February were 6 . 38 billion markka and imports 5 . 74 billion compared with exports of 6 . 72 billion and imports of 6 . 64 billion in January and exports of 6 . 92 billion and imports of 6 . 31 billion in February last year .
WEST GERMAN BARLEY , RAPE AFFECTED BY WINTER KILL Winter kill has probably affected West German winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree this season , West German grain trader Alfred C . Toepfer said in its latest report .
It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage , but it is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at risk because of insufficient snow cover , it said .
The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must improve to avoid further delays to spring field work , it added .

PORTS REOPEN , BUT FURTHER DISRUPTION LIKELY New Zealand ports reopened at 0730 hrs local time ( 1930 GMT March 22 ) after being closed since March 19 because of a strike over pay claims by watersiders , a Waterside Federation spokesman said .

Wilson said his members are holding stopwork meetings this morning to consider further stoppages over their pay claim .
The two disputes are not related .
Harbour Workers around the country went on strike for 24 hours on March 16 , but Wilson said any further action will occur on a port - by - port basis .

CITYQUEST MAKES 120 MLN STG BID FOR WICKES & lt ; Cityquest Plc >, a newly formed company , is making a recommended 120 mln stg offer for builders merchants and DIY ( do - it - yourself ) company & lt ; Wickes Plc >, Wickes said in a statement .
Undertakings to accept what is effectively a management buyout have been accepted by holders of 88 . 9 pct of the shares .
The statement said the offer was due to a decision by Wickes International Corp , a member of the U . S . Wickes Companies & lt ; WIX . A > Inc group , which holds an 80 . 5 pct stake , to realise much of its investment .
The offer would enable Wickes to become fully independent and once the bid succeeded all the Wickes directors would become members of the Cityquest board .

Wickes was last quoted at 345p compared with 275p at Friday ' s close .
Wickes shareholders will also have the option of taking one Cityquest share or 205p in loan notes for every 205p of the cash consideration .
Henry Sweetbaum is chairman and chief executive of both Cityquest and Wickes , and it was intended that Cityquest ' s name would be changed to Wickes in due course .

NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND NAIRA Nigeria ' s Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency , which has depreciated steadily .
The bank said in a statement that from April 2 , banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not , as presently , at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction .
This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower " marginal " rate , analysts said .
The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly , not weekly , beginning on April 2 .

GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF Debt among African countries will continue to grow and their economies will remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates , Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said today .
He told an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the widening gap between industrialized and developing countries and an unfair international economic system were major obstacles to growth in developing countries .
" I wish to emphasize that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries ," Mamman said .
Delegates from 23 countries are attending the talks of the world trade body in the New Zealand resort of Taupo .
JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy .
Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting that , in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September , a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987 / 88 budget is approved .
Hata , speaking at the first session of the two - day meeting , said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy , but did not elaborate .
Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever , reflecting financial deficits , payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries .

JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT Japan has launched a last - ditch effort to salvage its computer micro - chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further .
" We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe ," Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters .
" If hasty action is taken in the United States , it will create very serious problems .
" The Reagan Administration ' s Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year .
Under the pact , Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut - price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors .
Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports , and has threatened to take retaliatory action .
In an effort to save the agreement , MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export .
Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter .
This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year .
He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so - called grey market .
" We have almost no grey market ," he said .
" Supply is diminishing .
" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented , MITI called in the president of Japan ' s largest semiconductor maker , NEC Corp & lt ; NIPN . T > last week , he said .
It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of & lt ; Texas Instruments Inc >.
Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U . S . Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers .
The letter was sent today to U . S . Secretary of State George Schultz , Treasury Secretary James Baker , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter .
The four , who make up the Economic Policy Council , are expected to consider evidence presented by U . S . Chip maker Micron Technology Inc & lt ; DRAM . O > of cut - price Japanese sales in Hong Kong .
Yamamoto admitted that & lt ; Oki Electric Industry Co >' s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock - bottom prices .
" If the United States uses this as proof of dumping ... We will present our rebuttal ," he said .
The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI ' s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping , he said .
He also called the case " strange ," but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales .
He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week .

RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia , which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago .
Aweke Aynalem , head of the government ' s Agriculture Development Department , told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250 , 000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season , one of two each year in Ethiopia .
Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648 , 000 tonnes a year , of which 250 , 000 tonnes are produced from the " belg " ( small ) rains which fall at this time of year .
The belg rains are used to plant quick - maturing crops like maize and barley .
Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season , because farmers eat their stocks of seed .
Aweke said peasants in Wello , Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains .
The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser , and the rains should ensure a good crop .
AMERICAN MOTORS & lt ; AMO > STATEMENT QUALIFIED American Motors Corp said its auditors qualified the company ' s 1986 financial report .
The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding the previously announced arbitration award against American Motors ' former subsidiary , AM General Corp .
The award is being contested .
The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp ' s & lt ; C > proposal to take over American Motors .
American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award , made to Emerson Electric Co & lt ; EMR > in February , amounted to 60 mln dlrs plus legal expenses .
American Motors has challenged the award .
The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp & lt ; QLTV > in 1983 , the same year it was awarded a five - year , 1 . 2 billion dlr procurement contract with the military .
LTV and AM General last year sought protection under Chapter 11 .
The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the development of certain components in the contract .
The components were for the military ' s " High Mobility Multi - Purpose Wheeled Vehicle " ( HMMWV ), American Motors said .
In selling AM General to LTV , American Motors agreed to indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the Emerson Electric claims .
AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court , and faces additional legal challenges .
It said that , because of the LTV and Am General reorganizations , the final amount of a confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain .

MARKET LOAN COULD BE PINNED TO U . S . TRADE BILL Sen . David Pryor , D - Ark ., said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee ' s trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans , corn and wheat .
Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill , and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel .
The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U . S . cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports .
Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees .

ZINC PRODUCERS APPROACH EC ON VOLUNTARY CLOSURES A number of individual zinc producing companies have approached the European Commission to sound out its reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntary reduction of smelting capacity , Commission sources said .
The companies have been told that the Commission could not judge whether a plan would be acceptable under European Community , EC , competition rules until it had full details , they said .
In 1983 , the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss of about 130 , 000 tonnes of annual capacity , or about 10 pct of the total .
However , the industry did not proceed with this plan as zinc market conditions improved in 1984 , the sources noted .
They said the companies which approached the Commission recently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisage a loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983 .
CURRENCIES BETTER REFLECT FUNDAMENTALS - BAKER Treasury Secertary James Baker said currencies were now within ranges that better reflected economic fundamentals .

TONKA & lt ; TKA > SEES LOWER FISCAL FIRST QUARTER NET Tonka Corp said it expects results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four , to decline from the record earnings of 3 . 8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share and revenues of 53 . 2 mln dlrs .
The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower financial results to an an expected moderate decline in shipments of its Pound Puppies product line .
Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record results of 125 . 4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10 . 3 mln dlrs in net earnings or 1 . 47 dlrs a share .
The company said its level of shipments is good despite a conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry wide .
Tonka ' s first quarter shipments will be down somewhat from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down slightly from a year ago , it said .
Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and time large shipments for the second half , it said .
Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing last year ' s , bookings are " very good " for orders on several of its new product introductions for 1987 .

BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987 Bayerische Vereinsbank AG & lt ; BVMG . F > expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year ' s record levels , management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said .
He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks , especially those associated with foreign nations , had largely been covered .
Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986 .
Group bank net profit rose to 275 . 52 mln marks in 1986 from 222 . 73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187 . 63 mln marks from 161 . 58 mln .
Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2 . 71 pct last year from 2 . 78 pct the previous year .
But in the mortgage sector , the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0 . 7 pct .
Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986 .
Expenses for personnel had increased 7 . 5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9 . 4 pct to 272 mln marks .
The parent bank ' s 1986 partial operating profit , which excludes earnings from trading on its own account , had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks .
The parent bank ' s balance sheet total rose 5 . 3 pct to 81 . 5 billion marks at end - 1986 compared with end - 1985 , Hackl said .
It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1 . 1 billion mark increase in banking business .
The mortgage sector ' s share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45 .
Hackl said that in January and February this year , the bank ' s credit business had not livened up .
But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses , profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year - ago period .
He gave no detailed figures .

YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX U . S . trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community ' s Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats , another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture .
In a statement issued by the trade representative ' s office following a speech to the American Soybean Association ' s board of directors , Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers , who export some 2 . 4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC .
" This is an unacceptable situation for us and its ( vegetable oils tax ) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market ," Yeutter said .
Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT .
He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans , making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow - based margarine , and closer in price to expensive European butter .
" I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal ," Yeutter said .
" It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round ( of global trade talks )," he said .
BP & lt ; BP > UNIT TO BUILD GOLD EXTRACTION PLANT Amselco Minerals Inc , a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC , said it approved construction of a new plant with Nerco Minerals Co to process carbon ore to recover microscopic gold reserves .
The plant , to be located at the Alligator Ridge Mine near Ely , Nev ., will process 1 , 000 tons a day of carbon - bearing ore to recover 70 , 000 ounces of gold over three years , it said .
The plant will use a chemical process called leaching to extract the residual gold , which could not otherwise be economically recovered .
Operation of the plant , to be jointly owned by Amselco and Nerco , is set to start in October .
The Alligator Ridge Mine is jointly owned by Amselco and Nerco , a unit of Nerco Inc & lt ; NER >, which is 90 . 5 pct owned by Pacificorp & lt ; PPW >, a Portland , Ore ., holding company .
The mine has produced about 60 , 000 ounces of gold a year since 1981 using another leaching process , a BP spokesman said .
The open pit oxide ore reserves of Alligator Ridge will be exhausted by August 1987 , as expected , when the work force will be reduced to about 72 from 127 , the company said .

It has been stressed to ... Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government .

TRADE PROPOSES NEW EC GRAIN INTERVENTION RULES The European Community ( EC ) cereals trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention , which it claims could save the EC budget money .
It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later .
If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere , he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium .
Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution .

PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal ' s Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders .
Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders .
Under the terms of Portugal ' s January 1986 accession to the European Community ( EC ), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC ( Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais ) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 .
Following legal proceedings by private importers , Lisbon ' s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part , as it had done , in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports .
As a result of this ruling , EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80 , 000 tonnes of maize .
Barreto said , " My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part .
" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders .
Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator , whether public or private , from the tenders .
Private traders had argued that EPAC , given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market , had an unfair advantage over them .
" There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system ," Barreto said .
He said the EC ' s executive commission had accepted the government ' s view that EPAC should be eligible .
The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC ' s participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal ' s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency ' s import monopoly .

U . S . FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change U . S . farm policy .
The Senate could consider a House - passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented , or will prevent , them from planting their 1987 crops , Senate staff members told Reuters .
Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy .
Sen . Rudy Boschwitz , R - Minn ., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat , feedgrain , cotton and rice producers , an aide said .
Under current law , producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments .
Most major U . S . farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full - scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget - cutting pressures .
Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set - asides in return for sharply higher support prices .
However , Sen . Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , sponsor of the bill , told Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor amendment but to bring it through the committee .
TIN PACT SPECIAL SESSION THIS WEEK ROUTINE A further special session of the International Tin Council , ITC , held here tomorrow , March 24 , will give member countries an update on the latest debate over the hundreds of millions of sterling lost when its buffer stock price support scheme failed in October 1985 , delegates said .
But the ITC quarterly session scheduled for April 8 - 9 will be important , as the council will by then be wanting to decide on whether the current pact should be extended beyond June 30 or just allowed to expire , delegates said .
A two year extension is possible .
TIN COUNCIL WINDING - UP VERDICT APPEALED Amalgamated Metal Trading , AMT , today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council , ITC .
The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22 , when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC ' s buffer stock operations in October 1985 .
AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal .
The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict , Michael Arnold , head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations , told Reuters .
The judge ruled that the U . K . Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council , that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act , and that the winding - up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award .
AMT will contest all three points .
The U . K . Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding - up of what it defines as an association , and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition , Arnold said .
The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award , and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding - up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling .
The court originally decided that the winding - up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt , an AMT spokesman said .
The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months , but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28 .
This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC ' s assets .
Since similar arguments will be used in this case , it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT ' s appeal , Arnold said .
Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council ' s member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these , brought by J . H .
Rayner ( Mincing Lane ) Ltd , is to be heard on May 11 .
Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME ' s tin " ring - out " in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future .
The hearing date has now been put back slightly to June 8 .
ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas , ICO delegates said .
Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous , often heated talks , delegates said .
Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds .
Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting .

PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti - ship missiles , U . S . defense officials said today .
" We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers " to ship their oil , one of the officials told Reuters .
" But if there is superpower protection , we would rather it come from us ," the official said .
The officials , who asked not to be identified , said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels , most of them oil tankers , which could be supplied by three U . S . Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf .
" We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer ," one official said .
In addition to a half dozen ships in the U . S . Navy ' s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz , the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month .
White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran - Iraq war or Iran ' s recent stationing of Chinese - made anti - ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf .
The land - based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected .
Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 .
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U . S . strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz .
But he said U . S . ships in the region were on routine maneuvers .
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics , but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti - ship missiles in the region .
" We are fully prepared to do what ' s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world ," he said on NBC television ' s " Meet the Press .
" The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U . S . concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf .
The communciation was sent through Switzerland , which represents American interests in Iran .
Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran , Tehran Radio said .
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman , quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London , said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless .
" In conjunction with this misleading propaganda , America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions , aiming to build up its military presence in the region ," he was quoted as saying .
TIMBER REALIZATION & lt ; TRX > TO SELL REMAINING ACRES Timber Realization Co said it has agreed to sell its remaining 50 , 000 acres of timberland property in Mississippi for about 11 . 3 mln dlrs in cash .
Timber Realization , a limited partnership formed to dispose of timberlands and related properties transferred to it by the & lt ; Masonite Corp >, said that when this sale is completed the partnership will have received about 15 . 2 mln dlrs in cash and notes from the sale of its properties since December 23 , 1986 .
The partnership said it will terminate before August 3 , 1987 .
Prior to that date , the partnership said it expects to form a liquidating trust to provide for unresolved claims and liablities .
Timber Realization said the amount retained in that trust will depend on its experience in resolving open items up to the termination date , but it added it expects to retain a substantial amount in the trust .
The partnership said it anticipates making a cash distribution of an as yet undetermined amount to unitholders at or before the liquidation trust ' s funding date .

BOLIVIA ' S TOP UNION LEADER JOINS MINERS FAST Bolivia ' s top union leader today joined a hunger strike by 1 , 300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said .
Juan Lechin Oquendo , the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization , COB , told reporters : " I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike ".
Lechin , 83 , became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro .
The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9 , 000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay .
About 1 , 300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia ' s minimum monthly wage , which is 40 bolivianos ( about 20 dlrs ), COB leader Walter Degadillo said .
" I will take part in the miners ' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast ," Lechin told reporters .
The COMIBOL miners ' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry .
About 20 , 000 miners , or two - thirds of the working force , have been laid off through the government ' s decision to streamline the deficit - ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price .
The government , faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies , has called the miners ' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker , who began a four - day visit last Friday .
" I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike ," Lechin told reporters .
" I also have to orga - nise the strike .
" Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez , the miners ' federation top leader .
Although lopez has not joined the fast , union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner .

FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE , OECD SAYS French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said .
With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2 . 1 pct this year , the same rate as last year , unemployment could climb to 11 . 5 pct of the workforce by mid - 1988 , from its present 10 . 9 pct , it said in an annual review of the French economy .
The report said the French economy was " increasingly ill - adapted to demand " selling goods at " uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets .
" " France ' s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average ... And ... A substantial loss of market share ... In the past 18 months ," it said .
Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2 . 9 billion dlrs this year from 2 . 4 billion in 1986 , it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to " a ( renewed ) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries .
" This could result in further major losses of market share , particularly in the non - OECD area , which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports , it said .
Until the competitive ability of industry improved , the authorities would have " little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre , even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly ," it added .
But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands , contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next , the OECD said .
Written mainly in December last year , the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987 , and a 0 . 9 pct surge in January consumer prices , caused partly by the government ' s deregulation of service sector tariffs .
" We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises , and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost ," one OECD official commented .
OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report , indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2 . 5 or three pct .
The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2 . 4 and 2 . 5 pct from two pct , against last year ' s 2 . 1 pct .
But the OECD backed the government ' s view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year , with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year ' s fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation .
With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area , the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival , West Germany , could fall to just one pct this year , it said .
On the other hand , the report noted , consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits .
" For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability , it is essential that wage restraint continue ," it said .
WOLVERINE & lt ; WWW > TO SELL TWO SUBSIDIARIES Wolverine World Wide Inc said it signed a letter of intent to sell to an investment group two subsidiaries , Kaepa Inc , an athletic footwear maker , and its international marketing arm , Kara International Inc .
Terms were not disclosed .
Wolverine said the action continues the restructuring operation begun last July to make the company more competitive and profitable .
Wolverine said it will concentrate its effort in the athletic footwear market in its Brooks footwear division .
Wolverine said it expects " favorable results in the second half as a result " of its restructuring .
In 1986 it said restructuring helped improve its financial capabilities .
The company reported a 12 . 6 mln dlr loss , or 1 . 75 dlrs a share , in 1986 due largely to a 9 . 0 mln dlr restructuring charge and a 4 . 0 mln dlr inventory evaluation readjustment taken in the second quarter .
Since that time , it has sold two small retail operations , closed and consolidated five domestic footwear factories and closed about 15 retail locations .

SOSNOFF HAS SMALL NUMBER OF CAESARS & lt ; CAW > SHARES Martin T . Sosnoff said his & lt ; MTS Acquisition Corp > to date has received only a " negligible " number of Caesars World Inc shares in response to its 28 - dlr - per - share tender offer for all shares .
Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with Pratt Hotel Corp & lt ; PRAT > and Southmark Corp & lt ; SM > on forming a joint venture to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendly transaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest and Pratt and Southmark the remainder .
Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not being actively pursued at the presentand may or may not be continued in the future .
He said there could be no assurance that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would agreed to talks .
" Several preliminary contacts with representatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication that it wishes to enter into such negotiations ," Sosnoff said .
He said based on talks with staff members of gaming authorities , there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completed by the original April Three expiration date .
Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15 .
The bid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangement of financing .
Pratt , which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City , N . J ., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hotel and Casino , recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaign to acquire control of Resorts International Inc & lt ; RTA > against New York developer Donald Trump .
Southmark owns about 37 pct of Pratt Hotel .
Caesars World ' s boasrd has urged rejection of the offer on the grounds that it is inadequate and has said it would investigate alternative transactions .
Sosnoff currently owns about 13 . 3 pct of Caesars World .

IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER , OIL TARGETS Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends .
The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month - long lull in Iraqi air force action .
It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran ' s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday .
A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran ' s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time .
The Kharg terminal , attacked about 135 times since August 1985 , was last raided in January .
The communique did not identify the supertanker , but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it .
In London , Lloyds insurance said the 162 , 046 - ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday , when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack .
But there has been no independent confirmation of today ' s supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours .
The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight , when the Iranian tanker Khark - 5 was hit south of Kharg .
Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran ' s offshore oilfields at Nowruz , Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf , some 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of Kharg island , today ' s communique said .
The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years .
Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran ' s oil export trade .
A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front .
It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf .
Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled , it said .
TALKING POINT / WENDY ' S INTERNATIONAL & lt ; WEN > Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy ' s International Inc ' s stock , even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor .
Wendy ' s retreated from an earlier high of 13 - 3 / 8 , and lost a point when Coca Cola & lt ; KO > said the rumors were untrue .
However , Wendy ' s remained up 5 / 8 at 12 - 3 / 8 on volume of more than three mln shares .
Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors , yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible .
Wendy ' s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds .
Yet , a Wendy ' s spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article , which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill .
Market sources mentioned Anheuser - Busch Inc & lt ; BUD > and Pepsico Inc & lt ; PEP > as alternatives to Coke as acquirers .
Neither of those companies would comment , nor would the Wendy ' s official .
" It doesn ' t happen every day , every week , every month , but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies ," said Denny Lynch , Wendy ' s vice president of communications .
However , Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors .
Even before Coke denied the rumors , analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta - based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them .
" I can ' t put another name on it ," said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy ' s stock .
" It very well could be someone ' s interested .
" But Freedman said he doesn ' t believe now is the right time for Wendy ' s to be sold .
" They ' re obviously having operational difficulties .
I ' ve always believed at the right price Wendy ' s would consider ( an offer ), but I can ' t believe this is the right price at the right time ," Freedman said .
" If a transaction takes place , the buyer ' s going to control the situation ," Freedman said .
" I just don ' t think there ' s anything going on .
I don ' t think it ' s worth much more than where it is ," said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney .
Analysts said Wendy ' s has suffered largely from the " burger wars " between itself , McDonald ' s Corp & lt ; MCD > and Pillsbury Co ' s & lt ; PSY > Burger King chain .
Wendy ' s , the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U . S ., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year , analysts said .
Wendy ' s also fumbled when it introduced a high - priced breakfast , which it has since withdrawn , analysts said .
Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products , but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround .
There are analysts , however , who believe Wendy ' s may be vulnerable to a takeover .
James Murren of C . J .
Lawrence said Wendy ' s could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break - up basis .
He said the company has improved its debt - to - equity ratio and Wendy ' s owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3 , 500 .
" They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants ," Murren said .
Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year , Wendy ' s real sales , store for store , turned upwards in the fourth quarter .
" That was about the first time in seven quarters ," he said .
Caroline Levy of E . F . Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy ' s .
" My gut feeling is something ' s going to happen .
I don ' t know what ," she said .
She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share .
One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy ' s decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi .
Wendy ' s is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi , which holds a contract with the company , analysts said .
Pepsi ' s soda is still sold in the Wendy ' s restaurants .

EC COMMISSION SET TO DETAIL GRAIN IMPORT PLAN The EC Commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States , Commission sources said .
Under the accord , reached following U . S . complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership , the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 , 000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990 .
All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries .
The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year , as it was rather late to make other arrangements .
They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports .
There will initially be no tax on re - exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries , although such a tax could be imposed later , the sources added .

SOCIETE GENERALE REPORTS HIGHER 1986 PROFITS France ' s Societe Generale & lt ; SGEN . PA > bank , which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of this year , reported increased profits for last year .
Societe Generale , one of the three largest state - owned banking groups , said in a statement that its parent company profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs , up 21 . 2 pct on 1985 ' s 660 mln profit .
This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of between 770 and 800 mln francs .
The bank ' s parent company gross operating profits were up 5 . 4 pct at 21 . 34 billion francs against 20 . 24 billion in 1985 .
The increase in the bank ' s gross operating profits was mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal loans as well as the development of its financial activities , Societe Generale said .
Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up at 13 . 9 billion francs compared with 13 . 57 billion in 1985 while operating costs totalled 7 . 44 billion francs against 6 . 67 billion the previous year .
Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2 . 5 billion and 2 . 6 billion francs from 1 . 62 billion in 1985 .
FRENCH HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION FALLS IN FEBRUARY French household consumption of industrial goods fell 1 . 1 pct seasonally adjusted to 21 . 32 billion francs last month from 21 . 55 billion in January , the National Statistics Institute ( INSEE ) said .
This brought consumption back down to the December 1986 level , it added .
INSEE said that the fall was due to a sharp decline in purchases of clothing , which were high in January due to the cold weather .
The decline was partly compensated by a small rise in purchases of durable goods .
FRENCH ECONOMIC COUNCIL PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH France ' s Economic and Social Council ( CES ), an advisory body comprising industrialists , trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy , said the country ' s annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987 .
French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year , the Council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts .
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct .
Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country ' s economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment .
CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation .
Disinflation was an absolute priority , Neeser told journalists , adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years .

ENERGY ANALYST PROPOSES U . S . OIL TARIFF Energy analyst Edward Krapels said the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U . S . dependence on imports below 50 pct .
" On the supply side , the argument in favor of a contingent , variable import tariff is most persuasive ," Krapels , president of Energy Security Analysis , Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing .
" An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below , say , 15 dlrs a barrel .
On the demand side , the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels ," Krapels said .
But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal , saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas , repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies , allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U . S . oil production , or , at the least , preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling .
He also urging filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate .
Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices .

DIXONS SAYS CITICORP TO WITHDRAW CYCLOPS OFFER & lt ; Dixons Group PLC > said it received a letter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd , part of the Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp & lt ; CYL >, proposing to drop the group ' s offer if Dixons would sell Cyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp .
" Cyacq ' s main equity investor appears ready to pull out and deal directly with us for merely part of the company " said Dixons .

IBM & lt ; IBM > REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST International Business Machines Corp , hit by a two - year earnings slump , should begin a come - back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988 , analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C . Bernstein Co Inc said .
" There will be increasing momentum in earnings , albeit not until later this year ," Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm .
Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid - range area , rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U . S . capital spending .
IBM , whose stock hit a 52 - week low of 115 - 3 / 4 dlrs in mid - January , has come back lately .
IBM was trading up 7 / 8 at 149 - 1 / 2 dlrs .
Analysts , computer industry executives , and the company itself , have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM ' s growth .
But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies , and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp & lt ; DEC > to support his view .
" By replacing the product line , earnings have soared ," he said of DEC ' s line of VAX computers .
In contrast to DEC , IBM faultered with an incompatible mid - range product line .
A new computer code - named " Fort Knox " was supposed to tie together a number of IBM ' s mid - range systems , but the product never got off the ground , he said .
Instead , aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year , and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988 , Martin said .
" The major story will be a rebound in its mid - range business .
" He said sales of IBM ' s mid - range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986 .
But the new products will lead to 5 . 8 pct growth in mid - range computers this year and 30 . 7 pct growth in 1988 .
High - end computers , primarily the Sierra line , are coming to the end of their product life cycle .
Although growing 22 . 5 pct in the midst of IBM ' s sharply lower 1986 year , growth will drop to 1 . 5 pct in 1987 and 1 . 9 pct in 1988 , he said .
By 1988 , overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct , against 5 . 8 pct growth in 1987 and 2 . 4 pct in 1986 , Martin said .
Last year , IBM earned 4 . 8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51 . 3 billion dlrs .
Investors asked what this all meant to DEC , whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid - range area .
In response , Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC , nor DEC as a threat to IBM , because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases , rather than stealing market share from one another .
CITICORP ( CCI ) SEEKS CYCLOPS & lt ; CYL > STEEL UNIT Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd , a unit of Citicorp , said it wants to buy Cyclops Corp ' s steel assets from Dixons Group PLC and is willing to pay 124 . 4 mln dlrs , nearly 13 mln dlrs more than had been offered for the assets by Alleghany Corp .
The disclosure of the Citicorp unit ' s interest in Cyclops ' Industrial Group came in disclosure documents filed by Dixons Group with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Alleghany ' s MSL Industries Inc unit had agreed to buy the steel assets from Dixons Group for 111 . 6 mln dlrs .
Dixons Group has tendered for all outstanding Cyclops shares at 90 . 25 dlrs a share in cash .
The Citicorp unit said its higher offer came to about three dlrs more for each Cyclops share outstanding .
As a condition of its offer , it said Dixons would have to increase the cash price it was to pay for each Cyclops share to 93 . 25 dlrs in cash .
Dixons on Friday extended the expiration time of its tender offer until midnight ( EST ) March 24 .

BRUNSWICK & lt ; BC > SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first quarter sales to be up " dramatically " and profits to " do well ," chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities analysts meeting .
He declined to be more specific .
In the 1986 first quarter , Brunswick reported earnings of 23 . 8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396 . 7 mln dlrs .
Reichart noted that results of its two newly - acquired boat manufacturing companies will be included in the company ' s first quarter report .
Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American Games , he said .
He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving electronic features is being readied for test marketing this summer , and if successful , could " materially benefit " operations .
Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center , he said .
Turning to its defense operations , Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future .
At 1986 year end , Brunswick ' s defense contract backlog stood at 425 mln dlrs .
Frederick Florjancic , vice president - finance , told analysts Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently downgraded the company ' s debt which stood at about 665 . 4 mln dlrs at 1986 year end .
" We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down in the very near term ," based on strong cash flow from Brunswick ' s expanded boat operations , Florjancic said .
Shareholders at the company ' s April 27 annual shareholders meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares , a company spokesman said .

IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER , OIL TARGETS Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends .
The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month - long lull in Iraqi air force action .
It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran ' s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday .
A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran ' s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time .
The Kharg terminal , attacked about 135 times since August 1985 , was last raided in January .
The communique did not identify the supertanker , but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it .
In London , Lloyds insurance said the 162 , 046 - ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday , when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack .
But there has been no independent confirmation of today ' s supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours .
The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8 , when the Iranian tanker Khark - 5 was hit south of Kharg .
Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran ' s offshore oilfields at Nowruz , Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf , some 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of Kharg island , today ' s communique said .

Harper said no determination had been made as to any transaction and that its special committee is continuing in talks with interested parties in an effort to come to a conclusion in the near future .

1987 U . S .
SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAME - AMSTUTZ Congress should give the U . S . Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness , USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said .
Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing , Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program " dilemma " would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4 . 56 dlrs .
He indicated if the loan rate were 4 . 56 dlrs , USDA could then consider ways to make U . S . soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate .
Under current law , the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4 . 77 dlrs per bu .
Amstutz ' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4 . 56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4 . 77 dlrs .
The 1986 effective loan rate is 4 . 56 dlrs because of the 4 . 3 pct Gramm - Rudman budget cut .
Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs .
He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U . S . loan rate provides an " umbrella " to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U . S . soybeans .
Asked about the American Soybean Association ' s request for some form of income support , Amstutz said " the competitive problem is the most severe .
" He said USDA is still studying the situation and " no resolution " has yet been found .
COOPER DEVELOPMENT & lt ; BUGS > RESTATES RESULTS Cooper Development Co said it revised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61 . 7 mln dlrs , or 2 . 33 dlrs per share , down from the previously - reported loss of 12 . 1 mln dlrs , or 46 cts per share .
The restatement was made because of change in the method of accounting for a combination of several company - controlled concerns that resulted in a 53 . 5 mln dlr charge , Cooper Development said .
Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper Biomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with Technicon Instruments Corp , a company acquired from Revlon Inc & lt ; REV >, a Cooper spokesman said .
The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition , but the Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with the accounting method and said it should be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control .
This treatment requires that the costs associated with the transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an intangible asset , the company said .
It also said that , since the charged required an expensing of previously accrued liabilities , the company will experience no resulting material change it its cash flow .

SEC PROBES 1986 TRE & lt ; TRE > TAKEOVER ATTEMPT The federal Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp , attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said .
During the takeeover attempt , a unit of Sugarman ' s Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9 . 9 pct stake in TRE .
It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc , a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired .
In addition , a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies , and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock .
Finally , Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE , according to an SEEC filing .
The attorneys , who asked not to be identified , said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation , as would be required by the federal securities laws .
One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering .
A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE , since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America , had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe .
The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers .
A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe .
The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time .
" To the best of our knowledge , Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation " in connection with the TRE bid , he said .
A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added : " We had nothing to do with TRE .
" As a matter of policy , the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities .

WILLING TO TALK TO MOSCOW ON WHEAT PRICE U . S . Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of U . S . wheat prices but would not discuss making U . S . wheat prices " cheap .
" " There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap ," Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing .
Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the U . S . subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union , was over whether the U . S . wheat price was competitive or cheap .
" I think there is a ( U . S .) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness ," Amstutz said .
However , Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow " if the issue is being cheap .
" Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap , Amstutz would not elaborate .
Amstutz said it is the U . S . judgment that the long - term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at " prices in effect in this country .

USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union , while U . S . Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports .
" It ' s pure fiction ," said one senior official at USDA ' s Foreign Agricultural Service , referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks .
An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation , which he said was started by " somebody fanning the ( wheat ) market .
" Wheat futures strengthened today , partly on the basis of the speculation .
One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U . S . wheat , much of it before mid - year , if it was " competitively priced .
" Alexander Ivlev , an official with Amtorg , a Soviet trading organization , told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer , but said that Moscow " would consider " buying U . S . wheat if it was competitively priced .
" We don ' t care if it is EEP , what we ( the Soviets ) are looking for is competitive prices ," Ivlev said .
" If they ( the administration ) are interested in selling it ( wheat ), they should find ways to do it .

AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > APPROVES SHEARSON OFFER American Express Co said its board approved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit .
American Express also approved the previously announced plan to sell about 13 pct , or 13 mln convertible preferred , of the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs .
The preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common shares following Hart - Scott - Rodino and FDIC approvals .
American Express said it will maintain 60 pct , or 60 mln of the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding .
American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January , 1999 .
American Express said 7 . 5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed .
American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly .
American Express also declared a two - for - one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre - split basis .
Both dividends are payable May 8 , to shareholders of record April 3 .
There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding .
The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance , which is expected in April .
American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London .
The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management , market research and consulting on financing .
It also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected projects involving American Express , Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions , and to future personnel exchanges .
Under the agreement , Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate .
The cumulative preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to an equal number of common shares following the U . S . government approvals .
American Express said that assuming conversion of the preferred stock held by Nippon , 100 mln shares of Shearson Lehman common stock would be outstanding .
For the public offering , it said there will be an underwriters overallotment option to purchase 1 . 8 mln shares .
American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five - year warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at 100 dlrs per share .
There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding .
Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an adviser to the American Express board of directors .
" These proposed transactions are yet another signal that american express intends to stay in the forefront of the financial services industry worldwide ," said American Express Chairman James D . Robinson .
" The implementation of our plans , moreover , will enable us to maintain a majority interest in shearson while enhancing the strength of our balance sheet by tapping additional capital resources for shearson outside american express .

CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band , said Leo Melamed , chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ' s , CME , executive committee .
" The target zone would not affect our market I think at all .... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market ," Melamed told Reuters in an interview .
" We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift ," he said , referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s .
" One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value .
" As chairman of the CME in 1969 - 71 , Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures , which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange .
Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations .
" They can do it for a day , in terms of intervention , an hour , a week maybe , but not over a period of time .
So it ' s unrealistic and it doesn ' t work and it ' s unnecessary .
" The CME ' s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so - called " triple - witching " day .
" We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue ( triple witching ) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June ," when the move is scheduled to go into effect , he said .
Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor ' s 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading .
Two weeks ago , the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account .
The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups .
The changes " will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace .
That ' s going to prove very , very instrumental in increasing volume over time ," he said , predicting the increase would come within a year .
Melamed , also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc , said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12 - point limit on the S and P 500 index ' s daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program .
The CME also received " many negative comments , many more than we anticipated ," Melamed conceded .
Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit .

The Greens Creek venture is engaged in final project engineering of a gold - silver - lead - zinc ore body on Admiralty Island , about 15 miles southwest of Juneau , Alaska .

SPRINT OPTIMISTIC DESPITE LOSSES US Sprint , the 50 - 50 telephone venture of GTE Corp & lt ; GTE > and United Telecommunications Inc & lt ; UT > set up last June , is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year .
David M . Holland , president of US Sprint ' s Dallas - based Southwest Division , told Reuters in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter , but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost " about 500 mln dlrs .
" He noted the company was slated to spend 2 . 3 billion dlrs over " two plus years " to set up its network .
Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co ( T ) in order to lease its lines .
He said 16 , 000 miles of its 23 , 000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now " in the ground ," and 7 , 000 miles are operable .
By the end of the year , he said , 90 pct of the company ' s subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines ( instead of leased ATT lines ), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter .
Fiber optic lines , which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines , is quicker , more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables .
A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter .
" By the end of the year , we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U . S . long distance phone calls ," Holland said .
He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U . S . long distance market , with MCI Communications Corp & lt ; MCIC > about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct .
Holland said Sprint ' s rates , which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges , were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access .
He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year .
At the same time , he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January .
" We ' ve captured the fiber high ground , shown the importance of it ," he said .
Concerning the deregulation of ATT , Holland said he believed ATT " should be given some flexibility , but should be regulated on pricing plans .
" " They ' re so dominant in the market place ," he said , adding that ATT should be deregulated when " there is true competition in the marketplace .
" " It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money ," he said , adding , " maybe two to four years out , it ' s hard to say .
" Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint ' s two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders , such as the Belzberg family in Canada , might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss - making Sprint holdings .
" They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint ," he said , adding that he was " amazed " at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing .
" There ' s no evidence of that ," he said .
He said Sprint ' s progress in such areas as revenues , number of customers and construction was on track , even " ahead in many areas .
" Looking beyond the United States , Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988 .
" We want to be in every country that ATT serves ," he said .
He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it .
He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint , the forerunner of US Sprint , had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation ' s telephone network .
CANADIAN SEAFARERS THREATEN STRIKE Canadian seafarers are almost certain to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in wages and benefits asked for by their employers , Seafarers ' International Union official Roman Gralewicz said .
" It ' s 99 . 9 percent -- I guarantee you a strike ," Gralewicz said in an interview .
The union represents about 2 , 300 workers on the Great Lakes and Canada ' s East and West coasts .
Contract talks broke off in January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help settle the dispute .
The current contract expires at the end of March .
The seafarers ' employers are also asking for a reduction in crew levels , a move which the union said would cost about 400 jobs .

U . K . PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis , Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said .
He said in a parliamentary debate , " I can now tell the House ( of Commons ) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October ( 1986 ) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds .
" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise , he said .
The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point .
During a debate on the 1987 / 88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week , he said that " during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September , I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for .
" He said that that one percentage point increase , effected in October 1986 , had been reversed by this month ' s two half point cuts in banks ' base lending rates .
They are now at 10 pct .
Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1 . 0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986 , government sources said .

CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U . K . OUTPUT British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months , a Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) survey shows .
The CBI ' s monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1 , 685 polled U . K . Firms expect to raise output in the next four months .
Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged .
The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall , at 34 pct , was the highest such figure recorded since 1977 .
In the CBI ' s February survey , 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop .
The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal .
This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago , the CBI said .
In February , the figures were 24 pct , 22 pct and 54 pct respectively .
Companies also rated their export possibilities higher .
Of all polled companies , 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels .
In February , 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal .
At 23 pct , the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March .
On prices , the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months , up from 57 pct in February .
From 38 pct in February , only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July .
Six pct forecast prices will fall , against four pct a month earlier .
Commenting on the survey , CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling ' s more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports .
" But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British - made goods for imports here at home ," he said .

YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ).
Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture .
Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last September .
Yeutter said " at least people seem to be going down the same road ... But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely .
" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and " a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there ," Yeutter said .
However , the hard work is still to come , with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead , he said .
" It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy ," he said .
He said the long - term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas .
This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non - productive segments would stop operating , he said .
Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process , but it should result in a more rational system of world - wide production within 10 or 15 years , he said .
It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U . S . Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that , which is an ineffective use of financial resources , he said .
Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations , he said " one has to be politically realistic ...

SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT Swire Pacific Ltd & lt ; SWPC . HKG > is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow , reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses , share analysts said .
Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after - tax profits from operations will be between 1 . 525 billion and 1 . 8 billion dlrs compared with 1 . 23 billion in 1985 .
They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1 . 38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd & lt ; CAPH . HKG > unit last May .
Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59 . 1 mln dlrs in 1985 .
Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its " A " shares , making a total of 54 cents , after 47 cents adjusted for a two - for - one bonus issue in 1985 .
Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company ' s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits , analysts said .
The company ' s aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in & lt ; Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd >, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay .
Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1 . 23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985 , partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic .
Swire ' s share of Cathay , which stood at 70 pct before the flotation , fell to 54 . 25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50 . 23 pct .
Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29 . 5 pct to 115 . 5 mln dlrs .
Tony Measor , an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd , estimates Swire ' s profits will be 1 . 525 billion dlrs .
" Much depends on properties ," said Measor .
" And they did a lot better in the second half of the year .
" Estimates of profits from the firm ' s wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985 .
Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986 , well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period , but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats .
The firm ' s properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects .
Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1 , 100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second - half 1986 .
During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate , benefiting from low interest rates , analysts said .
" At the end of last year , flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1 , 100 dlrs per square foot , up by about 20 pct from a year ago ," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities ( F . E .
) Ltd . Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year .
The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development , which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986 , according to James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd . Swire ' s trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs , up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions .
( CORRECTED ) - PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR OIL LEVY Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community ( EC ) proposed a levy on vegetable oils .
Concepcion , speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) here , said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less - developed nations should not be disrupted .
He said the EC not only ignored Manila ' s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries .
Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers , he noted that " I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value .
" He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices , but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services .
" The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed ," he said .
TAIWAN COMPLAINS ABOUT SIZE OF RESERVES Taiwan ' s foreign exchange reserves , swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U . S . Dlrs , are becoming a problem , government officials said .
Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986 .
Central bank Governor Chang Chi - cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market .
It bought nearly two billion U . S . Dlrs between March 5 and 23 , he said .
Wang Chao - ming , vice chairman of the government ' s Council for Economic Planning and Development , told Reuters the rising reserves were " a big headache for Taiwan .
" He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U . S ., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U . S . Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products , especially those from the U . S . Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan ' s trade surplus , which rose to 2 . 73 billion U . S . Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2 . 02 billion a year earlier .
Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U . S . Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien - shien agreed with Wang ' s remarks and said efforts to avert U . S .
Protectionism were running out of time .
" We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington ," he said .
He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U . S . Companies .
Chang Chi - cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U . S .
Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses .
He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls , but declined to give details .
The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U . S . Dollar since September 1985 .
It opened at 34 . 38 to the U . S . Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end - year , some foreign bankers said .
AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY Australia ' s crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly - based approach , Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here .
He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government ' s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry ' s concerns .
Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation .
Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years .
These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on ' old ' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct , and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September , he said .
The industry , through the APEA , has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia ' s relatively low exploration levels .
" While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime , I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes , which leave ( government ) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas ," Evans said .
He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation ( RRT ) legislation , now before parliament , in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible .
As previously reported , RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas , based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects .
APEA has said it is not a true profit - based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects .
Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government ' s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime , adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules .
GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS - U . S . A successful new GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners , U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said .
Yeutter , in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks , told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient .
" That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round ," he said .
" The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems .
" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 .
Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time .
The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed , he said .
" Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that ' s the basic objective of the new GATT round ," he said .
But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour .
It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries , but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years .
" It ' s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two ," he said .
" They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future ," he said .

SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45 . 79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT Royal Dutch / Shell Group & lt ; RD . AMS > unit & lt ; Shell Australia Ltd >, said its net profit fell to 45 . 79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66 . 76 mln in 1985 .
Revenue fell to 4 . 55 billion dlrs from 4 . 91 billion , in an extremely competitive and over - regulated environment , chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement .
A 26 . 25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year .
" A return of 2 . 2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ...
In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct ," he said .
Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals , poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North - West Shelf gas project .
Duties , royalties and taxes rose to 1 . 37 billion dlrs against 852 . 72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation .
" It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy , technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production ," he said .
" The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way ," he said .
Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business , but further investment required an appropriate rate of return , he said .
Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18 . 77 mln dlrs from 26 . 35 mln , while investment in property and plant rose to 374 . 25 mln from 353 . 94 mln a year earlier .
Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth .
NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE WITH U . S . Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan ' s escalating dispute with the U . S . Over semiconductor trade , government officials said .
At today ' s Cabinet meeting , Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U . S . Anger over what it sees as Japan ' s unfair trade practices in semiconductors .
Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration ' s Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U . S . That pact , agreed last year after months of negotiations , calls on Japan to stop selling cut - price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U . S . Semiconductors .
Senior U . S . Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action .
Yesterday , Tamura ' s Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) launched a last - ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U . S . Policy makers setting out Japan ' s case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output .
In his letter , the contents of which were released today , Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut - rate prices in Asian markets .
In a separate letter sent to senior U . S . Officials , MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets .
NORTHEAST , EASTERN THAILAND FACE SEVERE DROUGHT Thirteen provinces , mainly in northeast and eastern Thailand , have been suffering a worse than average drought since mid - February and the dry spell is expected to last until early May , Deputy Interior Minister Santi Chaiviratana said .
Santi told reporters the government is launching a drought relief operation mainly involving the use of water trucks to send water to affected farming areas .
He did not say what crops have been damaged in northeast Thailand but said large durian orchards in eastern Chanthaburi province have suffered heavy losses .
The Minister said the affected areas include eight provinces in the northeast , two in eastern Thailand and three rubber growing provinces in the south near the Malaysian border .
U . K ., AUSTRALIA OFFER WHEAT TO BANGLADESH Britain and Australia have offered a total of 129 , 250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects , officials said .
They said 79 , 250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would be shipped next week and used for the government ' s " Food for Work " program in the villages .
Under the program , workers building roads , digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money .
The 50 , 000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open - market operations designed to stop price increases , the officials said .
Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month , market sources said .
But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month .

WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank ' s support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices , but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed .
Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto , he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy .
Indonesia , hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half , is the Third World ' s sixth largest debtor .
It has received 10 . 7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years .
Conable said the World Bank , which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments , was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices .
" We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy ," he said .
He said Jakarta ' s willingness to move quickly after last year ' s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries .
Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis , and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports , encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy .
However , key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place .
Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country ' s borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country .
SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations .
Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention , if necessary , in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations .
Canada , Britain , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels .
Sumita ' s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148 . 40 .
" It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates ," Sumita said .
The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system , he said .
The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries , the Paris statement said .
YEUTTER SAYS U . S .- JAPAN TRADE DIFFICULTIES REMAIN U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U . S .- Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April .
" We are having high level discussions on them ( the issues ) within the United States ... The relationship on some of those is very strained between us ( Japan ) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date ," he said .
" I am not sure we can wait until late April ," he added .
Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two - day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ).
He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries .
Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors , Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U . S . Super - computers and the barring of U . S . Firms from the eight billion U . S . Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka .
The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country .
" I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction .
The question is how far and how fast ," Yeutter said .

CHINA SAYS POSSIBLE GOOD HARVEST DESPITE DROUGHT China ' s summer grain harvest may be good despite a serious drought because the State Council ( cabinet ) has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti - drought work , a Hong Kong newspaper said .
Wen Hui Bao said the drought , which has affected Shanxi , Hebei , Henan and Shandong the most , has eased with March rains in south China and March snowfall in the north and as some new irrigation projects have come into use .
" If the drought does not worsen , there is hope for a bumper harvest ," it quoted experts of the Ministry of Electric Power as saying .
They gave no figures .
The 1986 summer grain harvest was a record 93 mln tonnes , up from 92 mln in 1985 , out of a total 1986 grain harvest of 391 mln .
The 1987 target is 405 mln .

TMOC TELLS SHAREHOLDERS NOT TO ACCEPT SANTOS BID & lt ; TMOC Resources Ltd > told shareholders not to accept Santos Ltd ' s & lt ; STOS . S > 4 . 00 dlr a share takeover bid pending advice from Macquarie Hill Samuel Corporate Services , its corporate advisor .
It said in a statement the Santos bid was below the underlying value of the shares as assessed by Macquarie Hill Samuel at between 4 . 08 dlrs and 4 . 72 .
TMOC , formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd , said the valuation was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of 2 . 55 dlrs a share by & lt ; Elders Resources Ltd >.
Elders Resources holds 19 . 9 pct of TMOC ' s 62 mln shares .
TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources ' response to the bid or that of its other major shareholder the & lt ; Australian Gas Light Co >.
The latter has a 10 . 5 pct stake in TMOC .
& lt ; Avalon Corp > of the U . S . Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC through an option agreement .
Santos , which is 15 pct owned by Elders Resources , yesterday said its bid valued TMOC at 248 . 5 mln dlrs .

TMOC said in the statement that the bid was unsolicited and that Santos had only a 3 . 07 pct stake despite paying up to four dlrs a share on - market .
TMOC has oil and gas interests and pipelines which complement the operations of Santos , the major Cooper Basin oil and gas producer .
TMOC shares today closed five cents up at 4 . 15 dlrs on turnover of 182 , 000 shares while Santos , due to release its profit result today , rose eight cents to 4 . 50 dlrs on volume of 245 , 000 shares .

WILLIAMS HOLDINGS SAYS IT BIDDING 542 . 2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS ORDINARY SHARES
WILLIAMS HOLDINGS SAYS IT BIDDING 542 . 2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS ORDINARY SHARES
WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542 . 2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS Industrial holding company Williams Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542 . 2 mln stg for the ordinary shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc .
The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros , or 432 . 7p a share Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p .
A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms , including a full cash alternative .
The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205 . 69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations .
The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros , for a value of 130p each and a total of 2 . 9 mln stg .
Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22 . 9 mln stg from 6 . 3 mln .
Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months , dealers said .
Initially it centred on & lt ; Bunzl Plc >, which once held a 2 . 6 pct stake , then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares .
Earlier this year , Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading .
In the six months to end - September , Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20 . 14 mln stg from 18 . 55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311 . 82 mln from 303 . 91 mln Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg .
A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln .
The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share , worth 428p a share .
The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400 . 2p a share .
The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night ' s close at 750p .
Williams said it held a total 850 , 000 shares in Norcros , or 0 . 7 pct , while an associate held a further 1 . 99 mln or 1 . 6 pct .
There was no immediate response from Norcros .

DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month ' s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates , senior foreign exchange dealers said .
Following its fall today to a record 148 . 40 yen , dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down .
Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month ' s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down , the dealers said .
" The recent remark by U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement ," said Koji Kidokoro , general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd ' s treasury division .
He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U . S . Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency .
" This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention ," Kidokoro said .
Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency .
They said the central bank bought between one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs today , including direct purchases through brokers , and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U . S . Central bank in New York .
Most dealers said they doubted the U . S . Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar , but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen .
" If the dollar drops to that low level , it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U . S . Securities , which the Americans don ' t want ," said Haruya Uehara , chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp .
He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986 / 87 business year ending on March 31 .
But dealers said the longer - term outlook for the dollar remained bearish .
This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U . S . Economy , the continuing U . S . Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package .
" The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan ' s inertia in stimulating its economy ," said Hirozumi Tanaka , assistant general manager of Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd ' s international treasury division .
In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures , after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed , to boost domestic demand , increase imports , and thus reduce its trade surplus .
The package was expected in April , but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax .
In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , Dai - Ichi Kangyo ' s Tanaka said .
Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U . S . Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar .
AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia ' s petroleum taxation structure .
The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government ' s position on taxation , as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference .
As earlier reported , Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad - based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum .
APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development , the council said .
It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans , but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax ( RRT ) legislation .
Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure .
" The government ' s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based ," the APEA council said .
The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry ' s concerns , despite its recognition of the industry ' s problems , the council said .
The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum , citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices .
GERMAN FEBRUARY IMPORT PRICES FALL Import prices in West Germany fell 0 . 7 pct in February from January to stand 15 . 6 pct below their level in February 1986 , the Federal Statistics Office said .
In January the import price index , base 1980 , was unchanged compared with December but 17 . 8 pct lower against January 1986 .
February export prices , same base as import prices , were unchanged compared with January and 2 . 5 pct lower than in February 1986 .
In January export prices fell 0 . 3 pct against December to stand 3 . 0 pct lower than in January 1986 .
NIPPON LIFE , SHEARSON TIE - UP SEEN SETTING TREND Nippon Life Insurance Co ' s 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow , securities analysts said .
The investment in one of Wall Street ' s top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position , they said .
" It ' s part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions ," said Simon Smithson , an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo .
The investment in Shearson Lehman , a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U . S . Retail brokerage , will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street , where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90 . 2 billion dlrs , they said .
Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan , they added .
The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50 - 50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management , market research , and consulting on financing .
Nippon Life is Japan ' s largest insurance company and the world ' s biggest institutional investor , analysts said .
The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April , making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U . S . Financial firm .
The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers ' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year .
Since then , they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments .
Last year , a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E . F . Hutton Group Inc unit E . F . Hutton and Co ' s board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman , Sachs and Co . Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem - plagued banks in 1984 .
" But now Japanese are going for blue - chip organisations ," he said .
" It ' s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries ," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co . " With a historically high yen , and historically low interest rates , there ' s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan .
" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings .
The typical salaried employee has 7 . 33 mln yen in savings , reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct , he said .
To stay competitive , fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation .
" The high regulatory environment has delayed ( life insurance firms ') diversification .
Now there ' s a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management ," Smithson said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 300 mln stg in the money market today .
Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take - up of treasury bills will drain some 338 mln stg while bankers ' balances below target will take out around 25 mln stg .
Partly offsetting these outflows , a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg and 25 mln stg to the system respectively .
SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer , Santos Ltd & lt ; STOS . S >, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil , condensate and liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ).
The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88 . 67 mln dlrs from 144 . 04 mln in 1985 .
Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy - Greene said in a statement that increased production , particularly of oil and LPG , along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays , were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate .
Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue , and had cash reserves of 381 . 3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401 . 9 mln a year earlier .
It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders ' funds had fallen to 1 . 01 from 1 . 54 .
Santos yesterday announced a 4 . 00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96 . 93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company & lt ; TMOC Resources Ltd > -- valuing the target at 248 . 5 mln dlrs .
Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U . S . Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge .
At year end it held 145 mln U . S . Dlrs , enough to meet all 1987 repayments .
Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program , finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia , but oil exploration was less successful with 1 . 62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year .
Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two - year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct .
Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism .
But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme .
" It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia ' s oil self - sufficency is expected to decline rapidly ," Massy - Green said .
P AND O PLANS WARRANT ISSUE TO MARK ANNIVERSARY Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc & lt ; PORL . L >, P and O , said it plans a free warrant issue on the basis of 10 warrants for every 150 stg nominal of deferred stock already held , to mark the 150th anniversary of the company .
Each warrant will give the right to subscribe for one stg nominal of deferred stock at 750p during a specified period in the five years starting in 1988 .
P and O deferred shares were last quoted at 629p , down 1p since yesterday , after the company reported 1986 pre - tax profit of 174 . 1 mln stg against 125 . 6 mln for 1985 .
P and O said 1986 produced an acceptable level of growth , though ground has to be made up in one or two areas .
The company has a strong balance sheet and considerable flexibility for 1987 , it added .
P and O will concentrate on expanding in its established market sectors .
Commenting on the recent ferry disaster in the North Sea off Zeebrugge , the statement said the precise cause is unknown .
The company has instituted an immediate investigation and both the British and Belgian governments are conducting inquiries .
The stricken ferry , the Herald of Free Enterprise , belongs to Townsend Thoresen , which became part of P and O in January .
P and O is considering listing its shares in Japan and other important overseas financial centres , the statement added .
CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time .
She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ).
Secondly , support for agriculture should avoid production incentives , and thirdly , countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices , Carney said .
Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively .
Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos , Switzerland , in January .
European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates , and not only the European Community , voiced reservations about some of the principles .
Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way .
" The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion ," she said .
However , the meeting did not identify what those areas are , Carney said .
She said Canada / U . S .
Bilateral trade negotiations , which must be concluded at least in draft form by October , are progressing well .
TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS The Central Bank said it issued 4 . 96 billion dlrs worth of certificates of deposit ( CDs ) today , after issuing 4 . 03 billion of similar CDs yesterday , bringing the total value of CD issues in 1987 to 139 . 46 billion .
The new CDs , with maturities of six months , one year and two years , carry interest rates ranging from 4 . 07 pct to 5 . 12 pct , a bank official told Reuters .
The issues are designed to help curb the growth of m - 1b money supply , which is expanding as a result of large foreign exchange reserves .
The reserves hit a record 53 billion U . S . Dlrs yesterday .
PHILIPPINE TRADE SECRETARY PLEASED WITH GATT TALKS Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion , who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences , said he was pleased with the latest gathering here .
Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal .
" Also , the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting .
Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries ," he added in an interview with Reuters .
" In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion ( in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations ) will be of more benefit to the developed countries ," he said .
Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a " shining act of faith " in the world trade system .
Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive .
He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non - tariff barriers , quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations .
Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples .
He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand , which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines , to encourage it to switch imports from other countries .
He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador .
DROUGHT HITS THAI RUBBER AND FRUIT GROWERS A drought that began seven weeks ago is hurting orchards and rubber plantations in Thailand and officials said it could last until May .
The government is trucking water into parched farms in parts of northeastern , eastern and southern provinces , but not enough to satisfy farmers , according to press reports .
There has been no official estimate of damage .
Officials of Thailand ' s rain - making institute said its airplanes could help little because few clouds were forming for them to seed with rain - making chemicals .
Thailand has a rainy season that normally starts in May and lasts to October .
MIYAZAWA SAYS U . S . LIKELY TO INTERVENE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament ' s Lower House Finance Committee that the U . S . Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates , political sources said .
Asked if the U . S . Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates , Miyazawa said yes , the sources said .
Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges .

GERMAN FEB SUGAR STOCKS UP IN YEAR , DOWN IN MONTH West German sugar stocks rose to 2 . 60 mln tonnes , white value , at the end of February from 2 . 50 mln at the same time a year earlier , the sugar industry association WVZ said .
However , stocks were well below the 2 . 82 mln held at the end of January .
Sugar exports between October 1 and February 28 rose to 449 , 253 tonnes from 435 , 727 in the same period of 1985 / 86 .
Sales to non - European Community countries rose to 419 , 541 tonnes from 349 , 511 , while sales within the EC fell sharply to 29 , 712 tonnes from 86 , 216 .
Imports in October - February fell to 59 , 605 tonnes from 76 , 044 in the same months a year earlier , the sugar industry association said .
Human sugar consumption in October - February rose to 817 , 856 tonnes from 799 , 128 in the year - ago period .
PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN TO REMAIN - EC SOURCES A ban by a Portuguese court on the state buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in Portugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice , European Commission sources said .
They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted that EPAC should be eligible , saying it had taken no view in the matter .
Under the terms of Portugal ' s accession to the European Community , a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 .
Lisbon ' s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part , as it had done in the past , in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports .
BANK OF JAPAN STEPS UP DOLLAR BUYING The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re - entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break , dealers said .
They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning .
Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen .
One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half - hour since the market re - opened after its lunchtime closure .
Another said the bank still has buying orders in the market .
SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations .
Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention , if necessary , in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations .
Canada , Britain , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels .
Sumita ' s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148 . 40 .
" It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates ," Sumita said .
The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system , he said .
The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries , the Paris statement said .

CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U . K . OUTPUT British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months , a Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) survey shows .
The CBI ' s monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1 , 685 polled U . K . Firms expect to raise output in the next four months .
Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged .
The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall , at 34 pct , was the highest such figure recorded since 1977 .
In the CBI ' s February survey , 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop .
The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal .
This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago , the CBI said .
In February , the figures were 24 pct , 22 pct and 54 pct respectively .
Companies also rated their export possibilities higher .
Of all polled companies , 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels .
In February , 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal .
At 23 pct , the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March .
On prices , the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months , up from 57 pct in February .
YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ).
Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture .
Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last September .
Yeutter said " at least people seem to be going down the same road ... But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely .
" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and " a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there ," Yeutter said .
However , the hard work is still to come , with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead , he said .
" It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy ," he said .
He said the long - term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas .
This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non - productive segments would stop operating , he said .
Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process , but it should result in a more rational system of world - wide production within 10 or 15 years , he said .
It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U . S . Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that , which is an ineffective use of financial resources , he said .
Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations , he said " one has to be politically realistic ...
If there is any chance of getting it ( agricultural trade reform ) done in two to three years it ' s going to have to be as part of a larger package .

NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan ' s escalating dispute with the U . S . Over semiconductor trade , government officials said .
At today ' s Cabinet meeting , Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U . S . Anger over what it sees as Japan ' s unfair trade practices in semiconductors .
Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration ' s Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U . S . That pact , agreed last year after months of negotiations , calls on Japan to stop selling cut - price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U . S . Semiconductors .
Senior U . S . Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action .
Yesterday , Tamura ' s Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) launched a last - ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U . S . Policy makers setting out Japan ' s case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output .
In his letter , the contents of which were released today , Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut - rate prices in Asian markets .
In a separate letter sent to senior U . S . Officials , MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets .
DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month ' s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates , senior foreign exchange dealers said .
Following its fall today to a record 148 . 40 yen , dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down .
Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month ' s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down , the dealers said .
" The recent remark by U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement ," said Koji Kidokoro , general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd ' s treasury division .
He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U . S . Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency .
" This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention ," Kidokoro said .
Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency .
They said the central bank bought between one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs today , including direct purchases through brokers , and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U . S . Central bank in New York .
Most dealers said they doubted the U . S . Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar , but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen .
" If the dollar drops to that low level , it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U . S . Securities , which the Americans don ' t want ," said Haruya Uehara , chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp .
He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986 / 87 business year ending on March 31 .
But dealers said the longer - term outlook for the dollar remained bearish .
This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U . S . Economy , the continuing U . S . Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package .
" The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan ' s inertia in stimulating its economy ," said Hirozumi Tanaka , assistant general manager of Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd ' s international treasury division .
In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures , after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed , to boost domestic demand , increase imports , and thus reduce its trade surplus .
The package was expected in April , but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax .

Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U . S . Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar .

JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY Japan ' s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3 . 0 pct in January , the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953 , up from the previous record 2 . 9 pct in December , the government ' s Management and Coordination Agency said .
Unemployment was up from 2 . 8 pct a year earlier .
Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1 . 82 mln people , up from 1 . 61 mln in December and 1 . 65 mln a year earlier .
Male unemployment in January remained at 2 . 9 pct , equal to the second - worst level set last December .
Record male unemployement of 3 . 1 pct was set in July 1986 .
Female unemployment in January remained at 3 . 0 pct , equal to the record level marked in April , August , September and December last year .
January ' s record 3 . 0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries , particularly in export - related firms , due to the yen ' s continuing appreciation against the dollar , officials said .
Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380 , 000 from a year earlier to 14 . 30 mln including 1 . 83 mln employed in the textile industry , down 190 , 000 from a year earlier , and 1 . 06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders , down 170 , 000 .
MAJOR NATIONS MUST ACT ON CURRENCIES - MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris .
In Paris , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels .
Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take , but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris .
The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning , piercing the 150 yen barrier .
Asked if major nations were now negotiating on what measures to take , Miyazawa said they were not as measures had already been agreed in Paris .
JAPAN ECONOMY MAY START BOTTOMING OUT SOON - AGENCY Japan ' s economy remains sluggish but is beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon , the Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet ministers .
But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen ' s exchange rate trend in the immediate future , Agency officials said .
The officials told reporters industrial production , down 0 . 5 pct in January from December , is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter , raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook .
The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2 . 5 pct in the current January / March quarter after falling 0 . 7 pct in the previous quarter .
A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2 . 7 pct , the officials said .
They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction .
Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels , the officials said .
They predicted exports will increase by 2 . 3 pct in the January / March quarter from the October / December quarter .
" But the problem is imports are not expanding ," said one official .
Imports fell by 9 . 4 pct in February from January .
KUWAIT SAYS OPEC 2 . 4 MLN BPD BELOW CEILING Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al - Khalifa al - Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher , according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview .
The al - Rai al - Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2 . 4 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) less than its 15 . 8 mln bpd ceiling , while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4 . 5 mln bpd .
As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs , demand for its oil will rise in April and May , Sheikh Ali said , adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota .

MIYAZAWA SAYS U . S . LIKELY TO INTERVENE Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament ' s Lower House Finance Committee that the U . S . Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates , political sources said .
Asked if the U . S . Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates , Miyazawa said yes , the sources said .
Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges .
U . S . OFFERS TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS IN GULF The U . S . Has offered warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti - ship missile batteries , Defence Department officials said .
The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe , chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff , during a Middle East visit .
Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran , but would not let Iran use Chinese - made " Silkworm " anti - ship missiles , capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf , to choke oil shipments to the West .
Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels , most of them tankers , could be provided by three U . S . Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman .
In addition to a half dozen ships in the U . S . Navy ' s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz , the Pentagon has moved 18 warships , including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk , into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month .
White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran - Iraq war or Iran ' s stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf .
The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U . S . Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf .
The communication was sent through Switzerland , which represents U . S .
Interests in Iran .
Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U . S .
Interference in the region would meet a strong response , Tehran Radio said on Sunday .
Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so - called tanker war , an offshoot of their 6 - 1 / 2 - year - old ground conflict .
YEUTTER SAYS U . S .- JAPAN TRADE DIFFICULTIES REMAIN U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U . S .- Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April .
" We are having high level discussions on them ( the issues ) within the United States ... The relationship on some of those is very strained between us ( Japan ) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date ," he said .
" I am not sure we can wait until late April ," he added .
Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two - day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ).
He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries .
Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors , Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U . S . Super - computers and the barring of U . S . Firms from the eight billion U . S . Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka .
The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country .
" I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction .
The question is how far and how fast ," Yeutter said .
BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6 . 5 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6 . 5 billion marks at today ' s tender for a 28 - day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3 . 80 pct , a central bank spokesman said .
Banks , which bid for a total 8 . 6 billion marks liquidity , will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22 .
The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3 . 4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires .
Call money fell to 3 . 60 / 70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3 . 75 / 85 pct yesterday , dealers said .
The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government - owned banks .
However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week , lessening the need for liquidity .
The call money declines surprised some dealers , who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today .
However , most said this had not occurred .
Banks were well stocked with liquidity , having 47 . 1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday , up from 49 . 9 billion on Thursday .
Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52 . 6 billion from 53 . 1 billion .
For all of March , banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50 . 7 billion marks , dealers said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET GIVEN 115 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 115 mln stg assistance in the morning session .

The central bank bought bills outright in band two at 9 - 13 / 16 pct comprising 73 mln stg bank bills and 42 mln stg local authority bills .
FORD & lt ; F > EUROPE EARNINGS UP 71 PCT LAST YEAR Ford Europe ' s net earnings soared by 71 per cent last year to 559 mln dlrs , Kenneth Whipple , chairman of Ford Europe , said .
Whipple , here to attend the Geneva Auto Show which opens on Thursday , said that the Ford Motor Co unit had sold a record 1 . 5 million vehicles in Europe in 1986 .
Net earnings were 326 mln dlrs in 1985 .
Sales in 1986 represented 11 . 8 per cent of the European market share , Whipple said .
Ford will invest 1 . 2 billion dollars in Europe in 1987 , and a total of seven billion over the next seven years , he added .
FRENCH EMPLOYERS CHIEF SEES HOPE FOR GROWTH The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic barriers within the European Community should help French economic growth and create jobs , president of the French employers ' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said .
" Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and accessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck ," he told Le Figaro in an interview .
He said that the majority of French business leaders were enthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an opportunity rather than a danger for their companies .
" It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much better than we could achieve in isolation .
We know that we have to reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous problems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to unemployment ," Perigot added .
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday that French growth would be just two pct this year , the same as last year and compared with the government ' s original 2 . 8 pct target .

WEST GERMAN 1986 SUGAR OUTPUT RISES West German sugar production last year rose 38 , 000 tonnes to an estimated 3 . 17 mln tonnes , the Agricultural Ministry said .

NO PROOF OF MORE CHERNOBYL GRAIN DAMAGE - DIPLOMATS Western agricultural attaches in Moscow said they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that last April ' s Chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on Soviet grain than first reported .
Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain from the U . S .
Helped prompt the rumours on world markets .
But the diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press and heard no comments from officials to substantiate them .
The official media was initially slow in reporting the accident but , under Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev ' s campaign for openness , gradually gave more and more details .
Land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varying degrees .
Some is now being used to grow industrial crops instead of grain .

" Tension in the Gulf has risen since U . S . Officials last week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm missiles .
The U . S . Has said it will not allow Iran to use the missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries .

Sumita ' s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148 . 40 .
" It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates ," Sumita said .
The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system , he said .
The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries , the Paris statement said .
COMDATA & lt ; CDN > ACCEPTS NEW WELSH CARSON BID Comdata Network Inc said it has entered into a definitive agreement to merge into a company formed by & lt ; Welsh , Carson , Anderson and Stowe IV > for either 16 . 50 dlrs in cash or 10 . 00 dlrs in cash and a unit of securities per Comdata share .
The company said each unit of securities would consist of 1 . 25 common shares in the new company and three dlrs principal amount of the new company ' s 11 pct subordinated debentures due 1997 .
It said the 16 . 50 dlr cash alternative is an improvement over the 15 . 00 dlr per share price contemplated under an agreement in principle with Welsh Carson announced on March Five .
Comdata said the cash and securities alternaitcve is subject to Welsh Carson - affiliated investors owning at least 60 pct of the stock of the new company .
The company said investment bankers & lt ; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc > and Alex .
Brown and Sons Inc & lt ; ABSB > found the proposal to be fair from a financial point of view .
It said the transaction is subject to approval by its shareholders and to Welsh Carson obtaining up to 230 mln dlrs in debt financing .
Comdata said it may terminate the agreement if financing is not arranged by April Three .
On Thursday , First Financial Management Corp & lt ; FFMC > offered to acquire Comdata for 18 . 00 dlrs per share in stock and cash , subject to approval by the Comdata board .
Under the First Financial proposal , Comdata holders would receive no more than four dlrs per share in cash and could receive all stock .
Comdata had originally planned a recapitalization under which it would have repurchased up to six mln common shares at 14 . 50 dlrs each .
IRELAND PUT ON COLORADO BEETLE ALERT The Irish Agriculture Department issued a Colorado beetle alert today after three of the beetles were found in a box of parsley imported from France .
Officials said a colony of the black and amber coloured beetles can destroy a potato field in a day .
The females lay up to 2 , 500 eggs each .
Some of the 80 boxes in the parsley consignment had already been distributed to markets and the department called on all shopkeepers and the catering trade to be on the alert .
DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month ' s Group of Five ( G - 5 ) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies , dealers and bank economists said .
" The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention ," one dealer for a German bank said , echoing widepread sentiment in the market .
But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists .
Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further .
Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention , the dollar plunged to a post - war low in Tokyo today .
It was quoted as low as 148 . 40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U . S . Currency to decline further .
" The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range ," Chase Bank AG ' s senior dealer Eckhart Hager said .
Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop .
" Window - dressing " operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U . S . Currency .
Dealers said main reason for the sell - off was not technical .
U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker ' s comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U . S . Administration to talk the dollar down .
" Suddenly , support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared ," one dealer said .
The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1 . 5 billion dlrs , and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge , dealers said .
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary .
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan , Britain , Canada , France , the U . S . And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact .
But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning .
Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act .
While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1 . 80 marks , others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1 . 75 marks or if the decline accelerated .
The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 , when the dollar threatened to fall below 1 . 81 marks .
" The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment ," one dealer said .
Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done .
Some said Baker ' s remarks and U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter ' s warning that the U . S . And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift .
" It ' s hard to tell whether the G - 6 agreement still stands ," a dealer said .
Another added , " If the Americans do not get what they want , they will push the dollar down , regardless of G - 6 .
" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter .
" It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U . S . Fiscal contraction ," Citibank said .
It added , " Markets should therefore be aware that 1 . 80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1 . 70 marks or even less is expected this year .
" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report , " We are looking for a further , more gradual , fall , possibly to 1 . 60 marks by the end of the year .
" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal .
Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker ' s and Yeutter ' s comments .
" There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down ," a senior dealer said .
TRANSNATIONAL INDUSTRIES & lt ; TRSL > SEES LOSS Transnational Industries Inc said due to continuing manufacturing difficulties at its AlloyTek Inc jet engine component subsidiary , it expects to report a net loss of about 300 , 000 dlrs or 12 cts per share for the fourth quarter ended January 31 .
It said revenues for the period were about 11 . 9 mln dlrs , about even with those of a year earlier .
For the full fiscal year , the company said it earned about 775 , 000 dlrs or 34 cts per share , down from 1 , 402 , 000 dlrs or 76 cts per share a year before .
The company said an unexpectedly large volume of customer inquiries at its Spitz Inc simulation products subsidiary has caused higher than expected business development outlays .
The company said it expects significant contract awards to Spitz later this year .
It said it has started implementing a plan to progressively reduce manufacturing costs at AlloyTek over the next several quarters .
The company said it may move AlloyTek ' s plant from Grandville , Mich ., to a lower labor cost area .
The company said it discovered the extent of the AlloyTek problems during a year - end review of subcontracts and related work in progress for production of jet engine components for General Electric Co & lt ; GE >.
It said it will release annual results around April 15 .
GREAT WESTERN & lt ; GWF > SELLS INSURANCE UNIT Great Western Financial Corp said it agreed to sell its John Alden Life Insurance Co and its affiliated operations for 280 mln dlrs to a newly - formed company onwed by the John Alden Management Group .
General Electric Credit Corp delivered a commitment letter arranged by the GECC Capital Markets Group Inc for the financing .
Great Western said the pre - tax gain on the sale will be approximately 65 mln dlrs , and after tax gain will be approximately 15 mln .
JAPANESE ECONOMIST SEES STABLE YEN / DOLLAR RATES The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U . S . Dollar for about a year , the Bank of Tokyo ' s economic adviser Koei Narusawa said .
" Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies .
The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150 , at least for the rest of the year ," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia .
Narusawa said the U . S . Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U . S . Economy before the 1988 presidential election .
The yen is trading at around 153 . 70 to the dollar .

SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1 / 4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today ' s auction , which a bank spokesman termed " heavy .
" Rates stood at 12 . 1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds , the spokesman said .
He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year ' s eight pct target for M - 4 , defined as liquid assets in public hands .
Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16 . 7 pct last month against 8 . 1 pct in January .
Growth was 11 . 4 pct in 1986 .
A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation .
The consumer price index rose 8 . 3 pct last year .
" Money supply control is the government ' s chief weapon against inflation ," he said .
" The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad .
" He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital .
The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short - term speculative capital from abroad .

GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS : U . S . A successful new GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners , U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said .
Yeutter , in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks , told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient .
" That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round ," he said .
" The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems .
" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 .
Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time .
The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed , he said .
" Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that ' s the basic objective of the new GATT round .
" But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour .
It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries , but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years .
" It ' s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two ," he said .
" They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future ," he said .
BELGIAN MARCH CONSUMER PRICES RISE Belgian consumer prices rose 0 . 11 pct in March from February to stand 1 . 27 pct above the level in March 1986 , the Economic Affairs Ministry said in a statement .
It said the consumer price index , base 1981 , rose to 132 . 83 points from 132 . 69 in February and 131 . 17 in March 1985 .
Year - on - year inflation stood at 1 . 00 pct in February and at 1 . 53 pct in March 1986 .
U . K . MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 104 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with assistance of 104 mln stg in the afternoon session .
This takes the bank ' s total help so far today to 219 mln stg and compares with its estimate of a 300 mln stg shortage .
The central bank bought outright 104 mln stg in bank bills in band two at 9 - 13 / 16 pct .
OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING , SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15 . 8 mln barrels a day , and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs , Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said .
He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U . S . And Europe which reduced demand for oil .
Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock , he said .
He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling .
Asked what Opec ' s output level was now , he replied : " Below 15 . 8 ( mln barrels per day ).
" He did not elaborate .
He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market , but if all Opec members stick by the cartel ' s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties .
He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987 .
He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting .
He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price .
" We hope the weak price will be overcome , and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters .
" Refiners , he said , appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall .
But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together .
PRINCEVILLE & lt ; PVDC > GETS LETTER OF CREDIT & lt ; Qintex Ltd > of Brisbane said & lt ; Westpac Banking Corp > of Australia has issued a commitment letter to provide Princeville Development Corp with the letter of credit required under Qintex ' s proposed acquisition of Princeville .

It said issuance of the letter of credit is still subject to conditions including appropriate documentation , but the letter is expected to be issued around April Three .
Qintex said as a result it has extended its tender offer for Princeville shares until April Three .
It said through yesterday it had received 7 , 424 , 292 shares under the offer .

DEALERS BELIEVE FED INTERVENED TO BUY DLRS The Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the U . S . foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning , currency dealers said .
They said the intervention occurred near the dollar ' s early low of 148 . 50 yen and the U . S . currency subsequently firmed to 149 . 05 / 15 .
It closed at 150 . 00 / 05 on Monday .
Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed ' s purchases were for its own account or for a customer .
But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan .
Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today .

OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY The government ' s industry aid and protection review body , the Industries Assistance Commission ( IAC ), will hold a 12 - month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry , Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said .
The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature , duration and extent of any aid , he said in a statement .
He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30 , 1989 , when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire .
Kerin said the broad - ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat - marketing system .
" The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry ' s capacity to adjust to any recommended changes ," he said .
" The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry , as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time ," he said .
Kerin was referring to the government ' s underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season .
The IAC ' s report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage , Handling and Transport , Kerin said .
He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat - marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry .

U . S . ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH The U . S . economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year , private economists say .
Some of the slowness experienced in the October - December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year , as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending .
But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U . S . economy , although some economists remain cautious about the outlook .
The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5 . 7 billion dlrs , a six pct rise , to 101 . 2 billion dlrs .
Even excluding volatile defense goods , durable goods orders rose a healthy 3 . 8 pct , the agency said .
The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts , whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct .
The January / February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year , said Lyle Gramley , an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association .
The U . S . jobless rate in February and January was 6 . 7 pct , the lowest rate since March 1980 .
The number of new non - farm jobs rose by 337 , 000 in February after a 319 , 000 gain in January and a 225 , 000 December increase , the government said .
The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3 . 25 pct in the first quarter , said Gramley .
Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter , Gramley said .
He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending .
He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi - family housing units .
Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue .
Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1 . 5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 , accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4 . 5 pct annual rate in the third quarter .
The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U . S . trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar ' s value over the last year and half .
" The improvement will be gradual and long lasting ," Levy predicted .
Most of it will be through import reduction , but at least one - third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U . S . goods become more attractive overseas .
The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit , which soared to record levels last year , will improve this year and the U . S . economy will grow by a respectable 3 . 2 pct for the year compared with a 2 . 5 pct rate last year .
As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit , the U . S . has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U . S . and others .
U . S . officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries .
The U . S . economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt .
The government last week said the U . S . economy grew at a modest 1 . 1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter .
There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad .
The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms , the U . S . trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 .
While fourth quarter economic growth was weak , corporate profits jumped a healthy 6 . 1 pct during the period , the government said .
It also reported that inflation , as measured by the GNP price deflator , remained in check , growing a moderate 0 . 7 pct in the period , the lowest rise in 19 years .
The government also reported that consumer spending , a key element of the five year economic recovery , jumped 1 . 7 pct in February , after falling two pct in January .
The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector , which had been one of the weaker elements of the U . S . economy , was showing signs of recovery .
In its latest report on current economic conditions , the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving .
Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish .
Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U . S . manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar ' s value .
He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity , but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either .
He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power .
" That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years ," Chimerine said .
He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years .
INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia , the Third World ' s sixth largest debtor , to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers .
" We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy ," Conable told a press conference at the end of a three - day visit to Jakarta .
Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia ' s hard - pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency .
The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan .
He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted .
But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes .
" The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government .
We are not here to dictate to them ," he stated .
Indonesia , the only Asian member of Opec , has been badly hit by last year ' s slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half .
Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto .
He voiced support for measures already taken , including September ' s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah , and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports .
" The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today ' s world ," he said .
The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10 . 7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years .
Lending is now about one billion a year .
The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia ' s protected monopolies in areas like steel , plastics and cement , western bankers and diplomats said .
The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures , but has given no timetable .
It is also considering selling off loss - making state companies .
Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects , which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed .
Japan ' s Ex - Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month .

IRAN WARNS U . S . NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE GULF The speaker of the Iranian Parliament , Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , warned the U . S . Not to intervene in the Gulf , a day after Washington said its warships were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway .
" If U . S .
Intervention occurs , the entire world will become insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be repeated for the Americans everywhere ," he said .
U . S . Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday that the U . S . Navy , which has about 24 warships in or near the Gulf , was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers , regular targets for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq .
Rafsanjani , in an interview reported by the Iranian news agency IRNA , also commented on earlier U . S .
Disclosures that Iran had erected sites for new Chinese - made Silkworm anti - shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz .
The agency , received in London , quoted him as saying that Iran did not need missiles to close the strait , 24 miles wide at its narrowest , because " we can close it with artillery only .
" He added " We have the longest coasts and the highest interest here and the small southern ( Gulf ) states have a lesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural for us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more than others .

COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL The failure of the International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today , coffee trade sources said .
Prices could easily drop to as low as 1 . 00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1 . 25 dlrs now , they said .
A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas .
No further meeting to discuss quotas was set , delegates said .
Quotas , the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement , were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil .
With no propects for quotas in sight , heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue , the trade sources predicted .
Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring , coffee dealers said .
The U . S . And Brazil , the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively , each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks .
Jon Rosenbaum , U . S . Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks , said in a statement after the council adjourned , " A majority of producers , led by Brazil , were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria .
" We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market , instead of their political influence in the ICO .
" Brazilian Coffee Institute ( IBC ) President Jorio Dauster countered , " Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas , not negotiate them .
" Previously , quotas were determined by historical amounts exported , which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60 - kilo bags .
A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme .
But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks , which would reduce Brazil ' s share to 28 . 8 pct .
Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries ' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it .
A last - minute attempt by Colombia , the second largest exporter , to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together .
Delegates speculated Brazil ' s financial problems , illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt , have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings .
Developing coffee - producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings , particularly some African nations and Colombia , are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO ' s failure to agree quotas , analysts said .
The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year , producer delegates forecast .
The ICO executive board will meet March 31 , but the full council is not due to meet again until September , delegates said .

SHELL TO DECLARE NORWAY ' S DRAUGEN FIELD COMMERCIAL & lt ; A / S Norske Shell >, Royal Dutch / Shell Group ' s & lt ; RD . AS > Norwegian subsidiary , said it has nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for Norway ' s Draugen oil field and will declare the field commercial in the near future .
Pending government approval of the scheme , the field could come on stream in 1992 , making it Norway ' s northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway .
Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988 , a Shell spokesman said .
Shell has not released projected output levels for the field , where water depth is 240 - 270 meters .
The spokesman said the field ' s partners have agreed to develop Draugen with a 300 - meter , single - leg concrete gravity - base platform .
The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production wells to tap the field ' s reservoir , estimated to contain 375 mln barrels of oil , and an offshore buoy - loading system to transport oil from the field by ship .
Partners on Draugen are Shell , the operator , with a 30 pct stake , British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP . L > unit & lt ; BP Petroleum Development ( Norway ) Ltd > ( 20 pct ) and state - owned Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A / S & lt ; STAT . OL > ( Statoil ) ( 50 pct ).
BOND CORP HAS NO COMMENT ON ALLIED SPECULATION Bond Corp Holdings Ltd & lt ; BONA . S > of Australia said it had no comment on an article in a London evening newspaper speculating on its plans for a bid approach to U . K . dDrinks and food giant Allied Lyons Plc & lt ; ALLD . L >.
Tony Oates , Bond Corp ' s Executive Director for Finance and Administration , said " The company does not comment on market rumors or press conjecture .
" He added in all instances of this kind problems are likely to arise whatever is said .
Allied ' s shares were 3p up at 401p , which values the company at around 2 . 75 billion stg .
London stock market analysts specializing in brewery shares viewed a bid from Bond , which they said has assets of around two billion stg , as highly unlikely .
They added that rumours of a possible bid for Allied have surfaced from time to time in the press and the London equity market ever since last year ' s thwarted approach from Elders IXL Ltd & lt ; ELXA . S > of Australia .
S . AFRICA GOLD MINING INDUSTRY HAD RECORD YEAR The gold mining industry had another " exceptional year " in 1986 with tonnage milled , revenues and profits reaching high levels , the Chamber of Mines said .
Nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled , three pct higher than the prior year , while revenues rose 17 pct to 16 . 5 billion rand and profits increased 6 . 5 pct to 8 . 31 billion rand , the Chamber reported .
The profit rise was achieved despite substantial cost increases and a 26 . 1 pct rise in capital expenditures to 2 . 42 billion rand , it said .
The chamber said that a " comparatively buoyant gold price allowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower grade ores which has characterised recent years .
" It said the industry now mines to an average grade of 5 . 63 grams per ton compared with 6 . 09 grams per ton in 1985 .
Gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tons compared with the previous year ' s 671 tons .

RICE , CORN LEAD 1987 U . S . FARM PAYMENTS - USDA Rice and corn farmers will receive the largest payments from the U . S . government during 1987 if the subsidies are calculated per planted acre , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted , followed by corn at 135 dlrs per planted acre .
Government outlays include mainly deficiency payments and price support loans .
On a per acre basis , cotton payments will reach 73 . 24 dlrs in 1987 , wheat 60 . 30 dlrs , sorghum 54 . 38 dlrs , barley 27 . 41 dlrs and oats 2 . 31 dlrs , USDA said .
USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 25 . 3 billion dlrs in 1987 .
The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday .

VOLVO GROUP COMPANY PROPOSES TWO - FOR - FIVE ISSUE & lt ; AB Catena >, in which AB Volvo & lt ; VOLV . ST > has a 48 pct stake , said it was proposing a two - for - five stock issue that will raise the company ' s equity capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln .
Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985 , despite an increase in sales to 8 . 54 billion crowns from 5 . 59 billion in 1985 .
The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs , which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985 .
Catena ' s increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986 , which changed the business profile of Catena .
It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer .
With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company .
In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB .
This yielded a profit of 386 . 7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena ' s pre - tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985 .
U . S . ENERGY SECRETARY OPTIMISTIC ON INCENTIVES U . S . Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was " optimistic " about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers , but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration .
Herrington , speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting , said administration debate over his plan for a 27 . 5 pct annual depletion allowance was " heavy and strong " largely because of some fears that the U . S . oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry .
Herrington ' s proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U . S . national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports .
In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp & lt ; MND > chairman , George Mitchell , Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif .
" We intend to keep that debate open ," Herrington said .
However , following his speech , Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee " is not economical .
" Herrington said , for example , a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation ' s gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs .
Herrington also said he believed President Reagan , who requested the comprehensive national security study , was committed to some action to help the ailing U . S . oil industry .
" I ' m quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it ," Herrington said .

Claremont added that it asked Champion to put two representatives on its nine - member board of directors .
Claremont previously disclosed in December that it had agreed to act in concert with Walsh , Greenwood and Co , an affiliated investment firm , to acquire Champion Products .
Claremont said it made net purchases of 7 , 800 Champion Products shares between Jan . 28 and March 18 .
In a March 20 letter to Champion Chairman John Tanis , Claremont and Walsh representatives Stephen Walsh and John Cirigliano said they were pleased with the company ' s performance but wanted to take an active management role .

SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy , the official Sudan News Agency ( SUNA ) reported .
Finance Minister Beshir Omer , quoted by SUNA , said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods .
SUNA , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation , said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel - Shakour Shaalan .
Sudan , burdened by a foreign debt of 10 . 6 billion dlrs , is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF , which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year .
In February 1985 , Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar , adjusting the official exchange rate to 2 . 5 pounds to the U . S . Currency .
Since then , it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments , arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices .
Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers .
Dealers in Khartoum ' s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5 . 5 pounds today .
With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency , black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries , mainly Egypt , Kenya , Ethiopia and Zaire .
Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks , but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan ' s economic performance .
The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four - year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country ' s economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears .
This , they said , could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors , grouped informally in the so - called Paris Club , to reschedule debt payments .
Twenty - three pct of Sudan ' s total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club , the diplomats said .
Sudan ' s Finance Minister said last month the country ' s IMF representative had told him the fund ' s executive board was " very pleased with the 18 . 5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months .
" The representative , Omer Said , said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia , to which Sudan owes about 1 . 4 billion dlrs , to help Khartoum to pay more .
Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30 .
SOUTHERN NATIONAL CORP & lt ; SNAT > SETS STOCK SPLIT Southern National corp said its board declared a three - for - two stock split , payable to shareholders of record on May 22 .

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR & lt ; NSM > CITES IMPROVED RESULTS National Semiconductor Corp said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce losses in the third quarter and nine months .
In the quarter ended March 8 , the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year - ago quarter , the company said .
But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns , it said .
The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25 . 6 mln dlrs or 31 cts a share from 39 . 4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter .
Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32 . 7 mln dlrs or 44 cts from 84 . 4 mln dlrs or one dlr .
Sales grew 23 . 5 pct in the quarter to 398 . 1 mln dlrs and 25 . 5 pct in the nine months to 1 . 36 billion dlrs .
Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter , the company said .
Despite the improvement in order rates and operating results year - to - year , pricing continues to be " aggressive for many products ," it said .
Nevertheless , it expects the semiconductor business will continue to improve this year .
The Information Systems Group will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends and new product introductions , it said .

QUARTERLY CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT NARROWS New Zealand ' s current account deficit for the quarter ended December 31 , 1986 narrowed to 567 mln dlrs from 738 mln , revised down from 742 mln , for the September quarter and from 733 mln a year earlier , the statistics department said .
The deficit for the year ended December narrowed to 2 . 75 billion dlrs from 2 . 91 billion dlrs , revised down from 2 . 92 billion , for the year ended September .
The deficit for calendar 1985 was 2 . 61 billion .
The December quarter showed a 182 mln dlr surplus for merchandise trade , unchanged from the September quarter surplus which was revised down from 271 mln dlrs .
The 1985 December quarter showed a 13 mln dlr deficit .
Imports for the December 1986 quarter were 2 . 655 billion against 2 . 883 billion in the September quarter and 2 . 454 a year earlier .
Exports were 2 . 837 billion against 3 . 065 billion and 2 . 440 billion .
Imports for the year ended December 1986 were 10 . 74 billion dlrs compared with 11 . 14 billion in 1985 .
Exports were 11 . 20 billion against 11 . 36 billion .
Government borrowing stood at 9 . 26 billion dlrs for calendar 1986 against 3 . 15 billion for 1985 .
Borrowing in the December quarter rose to 3 . 92 billion from 1 . 79 in the September quarter and 611 mln a year earlier .
Repayments stood at 5 . 5 billion for the year , up from 3 . 1 billion in 1985 .
Repayments in the December quarter accounted for 1 . 4 billion dlrs against 260 mln in the September quarter and 334 mln a year earlier .
Official reserves totalled 7 . 205 billion dlrs at end December compared with 4 . 723 billion at end September and 3 . 255 billion one year earlier .
EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT Emergency action to distribute European Community ( EC ) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme , a Commission spokesman said .
Almost 60 , 000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20 , when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme , and March 13 , according to latest commission figures .
The food , including 30 , 000 tonnes of cereals , 6 , 000 tonnes of sugar , 4 , 000 tonnes of beef and 13 , 300 tonnes of butter , has been distributed to the needy through charities .
The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year ' s unusually cold winter and will end on March 31 .
But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all - year - round system .
The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units ( 72 / 78 mln dlrs ).
This is above the 50 mln Ecu ( 57 mln dlr ) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers .
However , commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates .
On the other hand , the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight .
EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1 . 28 mln tonnes of butter , 520 , 000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals .
FED MAY ADD RESERVES , ECONOMISTS SAY The Federal Reserve may intervene in the government securities market to add reserves today , some economists said , although others felt that the Fed was likely to refrain from any action .
Those who believed the Fed will intervene said it would probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 1 . 5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements .
But others noted the Fed ' s current add - need is not large .
They also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower .
Fed funds , which averaged 6 . 21 pct on Monday , opened at 6 - 1 / 8 pct and remained at that level in early trading .
BERLINER BANK OUTLINES LOSSES & lt ; Berliner Bank AG > has suffered losses of between 25 mln and 30 mln marks on credits extended by its Stuttgart branch by bank officials who exceeded their powers , a bank spokesman said .

Late last week the bank said only that the losses from the credits in Stuttgart would be in the " double - digit millions .

U . S . COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies .
The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration ' s controversial off - shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment .
The administration said that the court - ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4 . 2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980 .
A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos .
But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration .
" Here , injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable ," Justice Byron White wrote for the court .
" And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined ," he said .
The oil companies , Amoco Corp & lt ; AN >, ARCO , Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, Mobil Corp & lt ; MOB >, Sohio , Shell , Texaco Inc & lt ; TX > and Union Oil , had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses .
The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2 . 4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs .
Administration officials , saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study , denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources .
The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins , along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta , argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing .
TRANSAMERICA SELLS OCCIDENTAL LIFE AUSTRALIA Equity investment company & lt ; Battery Group Ltd > said it had agreed to buy & lt ; Occidental Life Insurance Co of Australia Ltd > from TransAmerica Corp & lt ; TA > of the U . S . For 105 mln Australian dlrs .
The acquisition has been made possible by the efforts of its major shareholder , & lt ; Pratt and Co Financial Services Pty Ltd >, Battery Group said in a statement .
The purchase will be partly funded by the issue of eight mln shares at 4 . 50 dlrs each and four mln free options to the Pratt Group , controlled by entrepreneur Dick Pratt , plus four mln shares to professional investors at 4 . 50 each , it said .
The balance will be funded by debt , Battery Group said .
The acquisition is subject to the approval of its shareholders .

LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U . K . UPSTREAM PROFIT & lt ; Shell U . K . Ltd ' s > pre - tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2 . 12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year , Shell U . K . Finance director Nigel Haslam said .
But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations , the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1 . 45 billion in 1985 .
The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax , with Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ) representing only 16 mln stg , he said .
As a result , post - tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln .
Earlier , Shell U . K ., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch / Shell Group & lt ; RD . AS >, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg , up from 667 mln in 1985 , on sales of 6 . 57 billion stg against 8 . 81 mln .
Shell U . K . Chairman Bob Reid said the company ' s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373 , 000 bpd in 1986 , which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company .
Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340 , 000 bpd , due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field , he said .
Gas output of 5 . 9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 , he said .
A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months , Reid said .
The Kittiwake field , originally part of the 2 . 5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell , is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg .
Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields , which were approved last year , have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget .
Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year , and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant .
The company drilled 17 wells offshore , with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons , although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries , Reid said .
Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985 .
Jaap Klootwijk , managing director of downstream unit & lt ; Shell U . K . Oil >, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a " bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986 .
" In November and December in particular , refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices , he said .
He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer , although they could dip to become negative from time to time , depending on price movements .
A new catalytic cracker at Shell ' s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 , about five months behind schedule , following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year , he said .
Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site .
Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief , by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT , was " helpful ," but rather less than had been hoped for .
Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs .
If prices went much above that , he would expect some over - production above OPEC " s official 15 . 8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down .
He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding , bringing supply and demand into balance , but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall .

OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY U . S . HOUSE TAXWRITER A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herrington ' s " outrageous " plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy .
Rep . Pete Stark , a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member , said Herrington ' s plan for a 27 . 5 pct depletion allowance -- which in effect is a special 27 . 5 pct tax deduction -- would cost seven billion dlrs a year .
" He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle ," Stark said .
He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of U . S . tax on investment , 15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct , according to a recent Congressional Research Service study .

FED GOVERNOR SUPPORTS COMMODITY PRICE GUIDE Robert Heller , a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy .
Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation , Heller said , " A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring " as a guide to monetary policy .
" In times of rising commodity prices , monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices , monetary policy might be eased ," he said .
Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give " early warning " signs of wholesale and retail changes .
" There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis ," Heller said in a prepared text .
" But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend , a policy action might be considered ," he said .
Heller said using a broad - based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates .
Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods , he said .
He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy .

PRUDENTIAL RECORDS BEST RESULTS IN SIX YEARS & lt ; Prudential Corporation Plc >, which earlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre - tax profits , said it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other areas .
Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference that despite returning to trading profits , the International division and the Mercantile and General division had not reached satisfactory levels .
But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the International division .
The acquisition of the U . S . Life company & lt ; Jackson National > had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in the 1987 results , Corby said .
The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate agency firms bought last year , and hoped they will comprise between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future .
" We hope they will be very profitable very shortly .
We are looking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as well as the insurance products associated with them ," Corby said .
Prudential ' s pre - tax profits rose from 1985 ' s 110 . 1 mln stg to 178 . 1 mln stg in 1986 .
CRS SIRRINE & lt ; DA > TO TAKE WRITE - OFF CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a major restructuring of its balance sheet that will include a write - off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs , most of which would be intangible goodwill from the company ' s past acquisitions .
The company said the remainder of its write - off would include a one - time expense for future costs related to early retirement programs , office consolidations and an increase in the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies .
Bruce Wilkinson , president of the company , said the charges to the company ' s third quarter earnings , for the period ending March 31 , would " significantly impact " third quarter results but would not affect the company ' s cash position .
" We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the company ' s history by June 30 , 1987 , the end of our fiscal year ," Wilkinson said .
" We believe the action being proposed will begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988 .
" The company , which is one of the nation ' s largest construction firms , also said termination of its defined benefit retirement plan would produce a pre - tax benefit of about 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan .
In its second quarter ended Dec . 31 , CRSS had net earnings of 800 , 000 dlrs on revenues of 82 . 5 mln dlrs .

DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U . S . DISTILLATE STOCKS Tonight ' s American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7 . 5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20 , oil analysts and traders said .
They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels .
Analysts were divided on the crude stocks .
Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher .
Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels .
Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13 , traders said .
The API recorded a 7 . 4 mln barrel stockdraw for U . S . distillates in the week ended March 13 .
Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends .
For the week ended March 13 , API reported gasoline stocks down 2 . 9 mln barrels .
Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year , because retail prices are still low compared to recent years .
U . S . crude oil stocks were reported down by 4 . 4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13 .
Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week .
Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher , while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week .
The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell .
The API reported crude runs 154 , 000 b / d higher for the week ended March 13 .
Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20 .
Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices , traders said .
But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range , they added , the effect will be bullish .
Any stockbuild would be a negative factor , they said .
Crude runs normally increase in March , and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market , said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc .
STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near - term outlook for sterling , until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement , analysts said .
Since the six - nation accord last month , sterling has risen sharply , adding almost five pct on its trade - weighted index .
While the accord effectively stifled dollar / yen and dollar / mark movements , the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U . K . Interest rates .
But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday .
The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene .
Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively , the Paris accord could collapse .
" On balance , sterling would be a net sufferer if G - 6 collapses ," Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said .
He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies .
However , although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling , none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U . K . Currency .
Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U . K .
Political and economic outlook , firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates , they said .
Bullish sentiment on the U . K . Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week ' s budget , seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters .
Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies , where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U . K .
Recent opinion polls showing Britain ' s ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound .
In addition , sterling has so far shrugged off two half - point cuts in U . K . Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks .
A further half - point cut , widely expected in the next week or so , has already been largely discounted .
U . K . Base rates , now running at 10 pct , are still relatively high compared to other western countries , and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9 - 1 / 2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling .
Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar ' s decline , dropping only slightly on a cross - rate basis .
Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets , however , were reflected in the U . K . Government bond ( gilt ) market , where prices dropped by up to 5 / 16 point .
Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling .
Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday ' s U . K . Current account figures for February .
Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January ' s small surplus .
JAPAN ' S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3 . 5 PCT Japan ' s unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3 . 5 pct within the next year from January ' s three pct record , senior economists , including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan , said .
December ' s 2 . 9 pct was the previous worst level since the government ' s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953 .
" There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment ," said Takashi Kiuchi , senior economist for the Long - Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd .
The government , which published the January unemployment figures today , did not make any predictions .
" At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year , but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving ," a Labour Ministry official said .
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 , 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April .
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms .
The yen ' s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries .
Other export - dependent industries , such as cars and textiles , have laid off part - time employees and ceased hiring , economists said .
Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down , said Koichi Tsukihara , Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd ' s economics department .
However , other economists disagreed , saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years .
The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports .
Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations , methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare , economists warned .
" The three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used ," one economist said .
More than half of January ' s 170 , 000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24 , Sumitomo ' s Tsukihara said .

EC MEMBER STATES COOL ON CEREAL PLANS European Community ( EC ) member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the European Commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season , EC diplomats said .
They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes , taken together , would have too harsh an impact on farmers ' incomes .
Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission ' s overall package , they said .
As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals , the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices .
EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday .

SOUTH KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS NARROWS IN FEBRUARY South Korea ' s customs - cleared trade surplus narrowed to 110 mln dlrs in February from 525 mln in January , provisional trade ministry figures show .
In February 1986 there was a deficit of 264 mln dlrs .
February exports rose to 2 . 87 billion dlrs , fob , from 2 . 83 billion in January and 2 . 30 billion in February 1986 .
CIF imports were 2 . 76 billion against 2 . 31 billion in January and 2 . 57 billion in February last year .
STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD - DEBT PROVISIONS Standard Chartered Plc & lt ; STCH . L >, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry , boosted its bad - debt provisions in 1986 , chairman Lord Barber said .
Barber said in a statement on the bank ' s 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions , both general and specific , stood at 545 . 6 mln stg against 416 . 6 mln at end - 1985 .
Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision , which qualifies for U . K . Tax breaks .
New specific provisions rose by 111 . 5 mln stg while 71 . 2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision .
In all , a 184 . 2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986 , compared with a 100 . 7 mln stg charge in 1985 .
Total pre - tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985 .
" The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region , on top of the normal level of provisioning ," Barber said .
He said , " the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks .
" Barber said due to bad - debt provisioning , the Asia Pacific region made " a negligible contribution to pre - tax profits .
" He said the profits contribution from the U . K .
Businesses was " well maintained , although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning ," while Californian subsidiary Union Bank " showed continued growth .
" " Tropical Africa , Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued ," he said .
Barber said the group , which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank & lt ; LLOY . L > last year , strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg , while total assets increased to 32 . 2 billion .
Capital adequacy ratios remained strong , with the primary capital ratio standing at 7 . 5 pct at end 1986 , he said .
COLOMBIA COFFEE REVENUE SHARPLY DOWN IN JAN / FEB Colombia ' s coffee export revenue dropped 97 mln dlrs to 233 . 6 mln dlrs for the first two months of the year against 330 . 9 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986 , central bank preliminary figures show .
Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices following the failure to re - introduce international coffee export quotas , but they said Colombia could compensate the drop with higher exports in calendar 1987 .
Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2 . 33 billion dlrs , according to the bank .
Jorge Cardenas , manager of the National Coffee Growers ' Federation , last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln dlrs for Colombia .
But he stressed that Colombia , with stockpiles of 10 mln ( 60 - kg ) bags , had the capacity to export more and would use a recently - introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so .

CYACQ CUTS CONDITIONS ON CYCLOPS & lt ; CYL > BID Cyacq Corp , an investor group bidding for Cyclops Corp , said it amended its outstanding 92 . 50 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and modify a third one .
The group , which includes Audio / Video Affiliates Inc and a unit of Citicorp & lt ; CCI >, said it also obtained additional financing commitments , including an increased commitment from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd .
The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq ' s request for non - public information about Cyclops that was previously provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq ' s being satisified that the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop ' s published financial projections .
Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group , which has a 90 . 25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding .
Dixons said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight .
The condition that was modified , which required Cyacq to be satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons were rescinded or ineffective , now says Cyclops shall not have paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the consummation of Cyacq ' s offer .
Cyacq ' s amended offer expires midnight New York time on April three , 1987 , unless extended .
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group / Business Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln dlrs from 250 mln dlrs .
Additionally , the Citicorp unit and Audio / Video have increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs .
Of the new total , 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp .
Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407 . 5 mln dlrs to buy all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees and expenses .
It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25 . 5 mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer .
All previously announced conditions regarding the lending group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect , except that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq of equity contributions and other financing of not less than 210 . 5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213 . 5 mln dlrs for the merger facility .
Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made from Dixons , Cyclops or Alleghany Corp & lt ; Y >, which has agreed to acquire Cyclops ' industrial group from Dixons .
Under the alternative offer , the Citicorp unit , with Cyacq ' s approval , proposed to acquire the industrial group from Dixons .
TIN PACT EXTENSION LIKELY - ITC DELEGATES An extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement , ITA , for one or two years beyond June 30 is increasingly likely , International Tin Council , ITC , delegates said following a special council session today .
A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on April 8 - 9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning July one , they stated .
Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact .
The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd , AMT , against the January court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up .
In January the judge ruled that the U . K . Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council , the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the U . K . Companies act , and the winding - up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award .
AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important for the court to accept that a winding - up petition is a move to enforce an arbitration ruling .

JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP - EXPORT CURBS The Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U . S . To preserve a U . S .- Japan pact on semiconductor trade , but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness .
A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters .
Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate , but those without it will not automatically be denied licences , he said .
But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak .
U . S . Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement .
Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey - market sales by third - party brokers , who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement .
The MITI spokesman said , " If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company , it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means .
In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure .
" MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first - quarter 1987 , spokesmen for the firms said .
But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move .
" As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices , there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money ," a Hitachi Ltd & lt ; HIT . T > spokesman said .
KODAK & lt ; EK > TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS Eastman Kodak Co said it will reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber operations of its Eastman Chemicals division .
A company spokesman said the company will take " some writeoff " in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further " carryover " writeoff in the second quarter .
The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved , as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts .
Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially - oriented filament yarn , or POY , at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia , S . C ., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity , mostly in Columbia .
The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia , most of which are now performed by contract workers , and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport , Tenn . Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman , Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport , except Holsten Defense Corp .
Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30 .
Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision .
It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business .
All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year .
The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand .
It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman .
Carolina Eastman employs about 1 , 350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10 , 800 .
The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates .
HEAVY SIGNUP SEEN IN 1987 CORN PROGRAM - USDA With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program , Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year ' s level of 85 pct .
Enrollment in USDA ' s basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct , Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service , ASCS , officials said , with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program .
The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30 .
USDA will release its official signup report around April 15 , an official said .
USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa , Illinois , and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity , an ASCS official told Reuters .
A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup , the official said .
" A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program , but that doesn ' t look very likely now ," he said .
To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program , farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base , and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program .
ILLINOIS CO - OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co ., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years , will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution .
The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month , citing falling volume and increasing costs .
Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark , Inc ., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock , led to the call for dissolution .
The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership .
Ironically , it was Growmark , at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators , that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1 , 1960 .
But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur , Ill ., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies , ADM / Growmark .
With that relationship , Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative , said Tom Mulligan , president of the co - op .
Membership in the company , which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives , has declined from 99 in 1982 .
A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa , which became affiliated with Cargill , Inc . Illinois Co - op ' s other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain , based in Indianapolis , Goldkist , of Atlanta , Ga ., Midstates in Toledo , Ohio , Farmland Industries in Kansas City , Mo ., Farmers Commodities , Des Moines , and Harvest States in Minneapolis .
Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co . is a serious blow to the cooperative system .
Instead of banding together , the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways , said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant , he said .
Don Hanes , vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives , said 5 , 600 cooperatives exist today , down from 6 , 700 five years ago .
" The period we ' ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch ," he said .
" There ' s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co - ops .
" One problem , he said , is the co - ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export , rather than exporting it themselves , losing potential profits .
But exporting grain requires heavy investments , and the multi - million - dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co ., a co - op set up to export grains , served " to make folks gun - shy ," Hanes said .
Mulligan said he believes the dissolution , if it is approved , is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U . S . agricultural economics .
A grain dealer at one member co - op said the futures arm " was a convenience , something that saved us a little bit of money .
( Its dissolution ) will force us to change our way of doing business .
" " We ' re sorry to see the co - op go by the wayside ," he said .
" But there are lot of people out there to do business with .
There are plenty of capable firms .
" Steven W . Cavanaugh , vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain , said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago - based cooperative .
" In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals , there would be economic savings ," he said but added , " The times change and with changing times , come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around .
" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability .
" I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble .
It is a sound , healthy organization .
" In the year ended February 28 , 1986 , the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10 . 2 mln dlrs and members ' equity , or net worth , of 8 . 3 mln dlrs .
The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed .
Under the cooperative system , income from operations is returned as " patronage refunds " to the members .
Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining .
In the year ended February 28 , 1982 , the co - op reported income of 17 . 4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17 . 0 mln dlrs .
Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28 , 1986 , totalled 9 . 5 mln dlrs .
" You ' re dealing with substantially lower volume ," Mulligan said .
" Lower volume translates into higher costs .
" According to the company ' s 1986 annual report , Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co . Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to .
He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution .
Equity is distributed according to each member ' s trading volume and , as a result , changes from year to year .
However , Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out .
CONRAC & lt ; CAX > SOARS FOLLOWING MARK IV & lt ; IV > BID Heavy buying by speculators boosted Conrac Corp 7 - 7 / 8 to 29 , higher than a 25 - dlr - per - share cash tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc & lt ; IV >.
" It ' s a case of ChemLawn euphoria ," said one arbitrageur , referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per share and ended when ChemLawn Corp & lt ; CHEM > found a white knight willing to bid 36 . 50 dlrs .
For Conrac , the arbitrageur said , 28 dlrs per share seemed like an " appropriate price .
" Another said " it ' s too early to project the outcome .
" " The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate ," the second arbitrageur said .
But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today .
He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV .
Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers .
Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17 .
A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder .
" They ' re not beginners ," he said .
Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer .
" It ' s a hodge - podge of non - related businesses ," he said .
" There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it ' s presently structured .

Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets .
He said management has done a good job of turning around the telephone answering machine business .

BRAZILIAN SEAMEN SAY 14 , 000 NOW BACK AT WORK About 14 , 000 of Brazil ' s 40 , 000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike , a spokesman at strike headquarters said today .
The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27 .
The spokesman , talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro , said 126 ships were strike - bound .
He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships .
The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies .
Talks with the shipowners ' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime .
While exports have been delayed by the strike , exporters say the problems have been manageable .
" It hasn ' t been critical by any means ," said a coffee trader in Santos , who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships .
Economic analysts added , however , that any delay to exports served to aggravate Brazil ' s balance of payments crisis , which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt .

CALUMET INDUSTRIES & lt ; CALI > SEES 2ND QTR LOSS Calumet Industries Inc said it expects to report a loss from operations for its second quarter ending March 31 , despite a strong unit sales increase .
In the same year - ago period the company reported net income of 366 , 953 dlrs , or 18 cts a share .
Chairman S . Mark Salvino said the expected loss is primarily due to depressed product prices not recovering the increasing cost of crude oil .
Salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reduced rate of refinery production should increase product prices and lead to a return to more normal profit margins .
He reported that the 23 mln dlr HydroCal II system under construction at the company ' s refinery in Princeton , La ., is on schedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988 .
BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES Thailand ' s improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end - 1987 from a record of nearly 4 . 2 billion at end - February , private bankers said .
Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3 . 95 billion at end - January from 3 . 03 billion a year earlier .
Nimit Nonthapanthawat , chief economist at the & lt ; Bangkok Bank Ltd >, said Thailand ' s strong export performance , its relatively high interest rates , foreign participation in its stock market , and growing foreign investment , especially from Japan , contributed to the projected sharp rise .
Thai exports rose 19 . 4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year , bankers said .
A U . S . Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987 , up from a projection of 3 . 8 pct for 1986 and 3 . 7 pct in 1985 .
Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached .
Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold , special drawing rights and convertible currencies .
The target is equivalent to five - and - a - half months ' worth of imports .
COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER , DELEGATES SAY The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules , with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday .
" Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday ," a consumer delegate said .
" The atmosphere is excellent .
" Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1 , if the rules are agreed by Friday .
A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a " very interesting stage of negotiations ," delegates said .
The package , based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates , has been forged bit by bit during fortnight - long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates .
Producers , the European Community ( EC ) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow .
Under the proposal , the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second - hand market on an offer system .
He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired , delegates said .
The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis , rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before , giving preference to ICCO member - country exporters .
Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin , similar to golf handicaps , to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins , they said .
The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager , the delegates said .
Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council .
Buffer stock purchases from non - ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock , they said .
The purchases would be limited to 5 , 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 , 000 tonnes per week , and could be bought in nearby , intermediate and forward positions , they added .
One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is " transparency ," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager ' s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible , delegates said .
After the tin market collapse in 1985 , when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds , cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism , they said .
Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow , as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline , when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn , delegates said .
The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force .
The existing buffer stock of 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed .
Though the current semi - annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules , producers are keen to get the wheels of the market - stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices , delegates said .
FINANCIAL CORP & lt ; FIN > NOT HOLDING BUYOUT TALKS Financial Corp of America said it is not holding discussions with anyone regarding a buyout of the company .
But a spokeswoman pointed out that Financial Corp has said publicly for nearly two years that in the company ' s view a merger would be one method of increasing the company ' s capital .
" If an opportunity arises for us to strengthen our capital position quickly we would be very open to it ," the spokeswoman said .
Financial Corp would need over one billion dlrs to bring its regulatory net worth up to Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp requirements , the spokeswoman said .
In addition , she said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , in a letter dated January 26 , 1987 , stated that through March 31 , 1988 it will continue to support the company ' s efforts to restructure its balance sheet , maintain profitable operations and augment net worth .
PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986 The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100 , 000 barrels a day , Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said .
Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly , Hernandez said PDVSA ' s income from oil sales had dropped to 7 . 2 billion dlrs in 1986 , down 45 pct from last year ' s 13 . 3 billion .
Fiscal revenue from oil sales , which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986 , totalled 43 . 5 billion , a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said " had a very serious impact on Venezuela .
" PDVSA ' s export volume averaged 1 . 508 mln barrels a day , of which 658 , 000 bpd were crude oil and 850 , 000 bpd refined products .
The figure surpassed PDVSA ' s stated goal of 1 . 410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1 . 371 mln bpd .
But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25 . 88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13 . 90 dlrs last year .
The 13 . 90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1 . 01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank .
Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA ' s overseas refining and marketing operations .
Consumption in Venezuela ' s internal market increased from 323 , 000 bpd in 1985 to 342 , 000 bpd last year .
However , Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164 , 000 bpd .
Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes , shifting the balance of Venezuela ' s reserves away from heavy crude oil .
The country ' s production capacity at year - end 1986 was 2 . 562 mln bpd , of which 1 . 420 mln are light and medium crudes , Hernandez said .
Venezuela ' s total proven reserves as of December 31 , 1986 were 55 . 521 billion barrels , the fourth largest amount in the world , Hernandez said .

IMPERIAL OIL & lt ; IMO . A > TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT Imperial Oil Ltd , 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp & lt ; XON >, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near - term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending , the company said in the annual report .
Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987 , compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1 . 16 billion dlrs in 1985 .
Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2 . 69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4 . 27 dlrs share in the prior year .
Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years .
The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987 .
During 1986 , the company cut operating , administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12 , 500 .
Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained .
" It is still a time for prudence and caution , and the company ' s actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand ," he said .
Haynes said prospects for the company ' s petroleum products division are more promising than before , but are still uncertain .
Imperial ' s 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985 .
Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States .
The company ' s chemicals business outlook is mixed , Haynes said .
Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues , but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices .
Imperial ' s chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986 , compared to three mln dlrs in 1985 .

CPC & lt ; CPC > TO SELL EUROPEAN BUSINESS CPC International Inc said it reached an agreement in principle to sell its European corn wet milling business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA , a member of the Ferruzzi Group , for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs .
The transaction is expected to be completed by September 30 .
CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from the transaction .
But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed , it said .
The long - term effect of the transaction on CPC ' s earnings should be positive , it added , as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business .
The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November , CPC said .
Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring .
As of December 31 , CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares , adjusted for a 2 - for - 1 split in January , for a total cost of 621 . 8 mln dlrs , according to its 1986 annual report .
In December , CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs .
CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt , including that incurred under the share buyback .
In total , CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock , adjusted for the split , it said today .
In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares , adjusted for the split .
The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in November , after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman , chairman of Revlon Group Inc & lt ; REV >, acquired about 7 . 6 pct of CPC ' s then outstanding stock .
In 1986 , the European corn wet milling business had sales of 914 . 1 mln dlrs , operating income before overheads of 68 . 8 mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19 . 7 mln dlrs , according to CPC ' s 1986 annual report .
The businesses ' assets were 645 . 7 mln dlrs in 1986 , the report said .

U . S . HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS The U . S . House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet - bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U . S . national security .
The Democratic - controlled committee said the administration ' s export control policies , which restrict shipment of thousands of products , contributed to last year ' s record 169 billion dlr U . S . trade deficit .
The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U . S . companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries .
Rep . Don Bonker , chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee , said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U . S . 17 billion dlrs in exports a year .
" This is Congress ' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more ," the Washington Democrat said .
The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls .
Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments .
It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly - sensitive technology .

CITICORP & lt ; CCI > RULES OUT CREDIT CARD PRICE WAR American Express Co ' s & lt ; AXP > recent launch of a new " OPTIMA " credit card , with relatively low interest rates and fees , will increase competition with bank credit - card issuers but will not lead to a pricing war , a senior Citicorp offical said .
" Over the next two to three years , a very interesting marketing battle will be fought ... competition will not be on price but on product features ," Pei - yuan Chia , head of the U . S . card products group , told a banking analysts meeting .
Citicorp is the leading U . S . bank credit - card issuer , with some 10 mln accounts and an 11 pct market share .
Chia said that Citicorp would focus its credit card marketing efforts on acceptance , noting that Visa and Mastercard currently enjoy a two - to - one advantage over American Express in terms of worldwide acceptance .
He also doubted the popularity of American Express ' plan to link interest charges on the new OPTIMA card to the bank prime lending rate .
" The consumer likes to have a fixed rate instrument ," he said .
Richard Braddock , head of the whole individual banking division , added that when there is increased competition , " it is not the big people who get crunched but the small ones .

BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly - industrialized countries ( NICS ) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit .
" We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products ," or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar , Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee .
The U . S . dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies , but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar .
As a result , efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries .
Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates .

UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN William Bywater , president of the International Union of Electronic Workers , called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade .
He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming " one of the world ' s industrial lightweights .
" Bywater ' s remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U . S .- Japanese semiconductors agreement .
The pact , agreed to last July , called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U . S . goods .
In return , Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors .
But U . S . officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U . S . market , it has not ended third country dumping ; nor has it opened its market to U . S . semiconductors .
Japan yesterday , in an effort to ward off U . S . action , ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping .
Bywater , in his statement , said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U . S . industory more competitive .
But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry .
Bywater said , " I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U . S . law and GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ).

DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar ' s losses today , but senior dealers here believe the U . S . currency is headed for a further retreat .
Although the intervention was widespread , dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies .
Moreover , hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline , dealers said .
" The market can be bigger than the central banks .
And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore ," said a dealer at one major U . S . bank .
As the dollar dropped to post - World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan , Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U . S . currency .
Reports of the authorities ' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149 . 45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post - war low of 148 . 20 yen in the Far East .
But it still failed to regain Monday ' s U . S . closing level of 150 . 00 / 05 yen .
Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U . S . via the Federal Reserve .
Meanwhile , there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148 . 50 yen today .
Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen .
The Fed ' s last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan .
But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1 . 87 marks .
The authorities ' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U . S ., Japan , West Germany , Britain , France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels .
But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities ' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market .
For one thing , some dealers believed that the Fed ' s purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U . S . central bank ' s own account , suggesting a rather watered - down American commitment to the currency accord .
The Bank of England ' s action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank , reinforcing the market ' s view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact .
" No - one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious .
But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else ," said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp . " I ' m not convinced the intervention was concerted ," said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago .
" It ' s a yen problem more than anything else .
" Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U . S . limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen .
" The dollar ' s break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury ' s hands behind its back .
The U . S . cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here ," said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp .
Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized .
Despite official denials , some traders still feel the U . S . would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation ' s trade deficit .
The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan .
Indeed U . S . Treasury secretary James Baker ' s comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U . S . currency and kicked off the latest retreat .
" The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services .
The currency market is becoming very political ," said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd . Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May .
Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies , it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future , dealers said .
" Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year , it won ' t be enough to help the trade situation much ," said Bourdain of BankAmerica , who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days .

PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive , Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters .
" The peso / dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive ," Monsod said an interview .
" No question about it .
I ' m saying you cannot argue with success .
Taiwan , South Korea , West Germany , Japan , all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies .
" The peso has been free - floating since June 1984 .
It is currently at about 20 . 50 to the U . S . Dollar .
Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions .
Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance .
" If the dollar rate goes higher , our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher , so the financing is very difficult ," she said .
" But I am looking at it in terms of the economy .
" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy .
" I ' m just saying , keep it competitive .
I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead .
" Monsod said , " The ideal movement in the peso / dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation ( rates ) of the Philippines versus the other country .
It ' s an arithmetic thing .
" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0 . 8 pct in calendar 1986 .
Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year .
He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso / dollar 1987 target rate at 20 . 80 .
The peso lost 22 . 2 pct in value to slump to 18 . 002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984 .

CHARTER CO & lt ; QCHR > TO COMPLETE REORGANIZATION Charter Co , the huge petrochemical concern in bankruptcy proceedings stemming from hundreds of dioxin - related claims , said it and all of its subsidiaries , except the Independent Petrochemical Corp , will complete their reorganization on March 31 .
It said that on that date , it will deposit with an escrow agent 288 . 8 mln dlrs in cash , 66 . 7 mln dlrs in notes and 31 mln shares of its common for distribution .
Company officials were not immediately available for comment .
As previously reported , Charter settled dioxin - related claims for about 1 , 200 individuals and the state of Missouri , resolving claims against it and all subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical .
Charter said some of the settlements remain subject to appeals and final court approvals and resolve claims against charter and its subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical .
It said about 500 individual claims against it and certain of its units remain pending as disputed claims in bankruptcy court .
It said about 300 of these claims have been filed since confirmation of the joint plan of reorganization .
Charter said its two creditors , an equity committee in its bankruptcy proceedings and & lt ; American Financial Corp >, which will own 50 . 5 pct of its common after the reorganization , have waived the requirement that Charter resolve all dioxin - related claims against it prior to completing its reorganization .
That requirement excludes claims against Independent Petrochemical .

RESORTS INT ' L & lt ; RT . A > RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER Resorts International Inc said it received a proposal from & lt ; KSZ Co Inc > under which holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be formed through the takeover .
Under the offer , Resorts said holders of its class A shares would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of common stock in the new company .
Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc , a newly formed Delaware corporation .
Resorts said that prior to the merger , RI Acquisition would be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220 mln dlrs of equity .
It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of special preferred stock .
The KSZ offer , Resorts said , indicates that KSZ has a commitment from & lt ; M . Davies Cos > to buy all of the special preferred stock .
Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27 .
It said it asked its investment advisor , Bear , Stearns and Co , to advise its board on the offer .
Earlier this month , the estate of James M . Crosby and certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs a share .
The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the 752 , 297 class B shares outstanding .
Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining class B shares outstanding .
Resorts also has about 5 , 680 , 000 shares of outstanding class A stock .
These shares carry one one - hundredth the voting power of the class B shares .
Trump ' s offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made by Pratt Hotel Corp & lt ; PRAT >.
Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ , existing class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire Resorts .
Resorts said the new company , upon completion of the merger , would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the special preferred stock would immediately be converted into exchangeable participating preferred of the new company .
This preferred , Resorts said , would pay a dividend based on the net cash flows from the new company ' s Paradise Island operations .
A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a two - page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it because it did not contain enough information .
Resorts has asked Bear , Sterns to obtain complete data , he said .
The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis , the Denver oilman .
Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters , who handles public relations for Davis .
Solters , said to be travelling , was not immediately available for comment .
Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment , as was a spokesman for the Crosby estate .

FED ' S JOHNSON SAYS DOLLAR STABILIZED AFTER FED TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTION
FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , Paul Volcker , has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday .
Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St . Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U . S . firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U . S . firms abroad .
He added , " even Japan , against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed ," has started opening its markets .
In his letter , made available at the Treasury , Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks , was a problem .
" I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt ," Volcker said .
It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries , he said .
Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker " about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt , which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility .
" He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates " is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects .
" " For example , the bill ' s directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations ," Volcker said .

U . S . CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U . S . corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years , Agriculture Department officials said .
USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 .
Agriculture Department analysts said next week ' s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres , down 22 pct from last year ' s plantings of 83 . 3 mln acres .
Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings , U . S . corn production will also decrease significantly .
Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels .
Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program , along with 1 . 9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program , will cause acreage to plummet , Department feedgrain analysts said .
" There ' s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage ," one said .
" It ' s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year .
" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct , USDA analysts said .
Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below , they said , compared to last year ' s level of 61 . 5 mln acres .
If analysts ' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u . s . corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment - In - Kind program .
Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 .
A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4 . 2 billion bushels .
Given normal weather conditions this year , USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels , down from last year ' s crop of 8 . 3 billion bushels .
" This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production ," an analyst said .
A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U . S . corn usage , so surplus stocks , while not decreasing , would not increase significantly , a specialist said .
High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions , based upon historical participation in government programs , analysts said .
In contrast , soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt , a USDA soybean analyst said .
" Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge ," he said .
Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher - producing delta areas .
Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year ' s 2 . 0 billion bushels to 1 . 8 to 1 . 9 billion , he said .
U . S . soybean acreage , after soaring to 71 . 4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that , has steadily declined in the 1980 ' s .
U . S . corn acreage , with the exception of 1983 , has been in the low to mid 80 - mln acre range for the past 10 years .
The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26 . 5 bushels per acre .
Last year U . S . farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119 . 3 bushels per acre .
" We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so ," an analyst said .
Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same , analysts said .
Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage .
" To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres , we would have to provide more incentives ," an analyst said .
KIRSCHNER & lt ; KMDC > COMPLETES PURCHASE Kirschner Medical corp said it completed the acquisition of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing ' s & lt ; MMM > orthopedic metal implant line division .
The acquisition price is 12 . 0 mln dlrs in cash , a six mln dlr three year note and 100 , 000 shares of Kirschner common stock .
The division had sales of 11 . 3 mln dlrs in 1986 .
U . S .
SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS Leading U . S . farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate ' s omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s export enhancement program , EEP , to include traditional buyers of U . S . farm products , including the Soviet Union , Senate staff said .
Under existing criteria , USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations ' unfair trading practices .
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt .) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies , sources said .
The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D - Tex .
), Max Baucus ( D - Mont .
), David Pryor ( D - Ark .
), John Melcher ( D - Mont .
) and Thad Cochran ( R - Miss .
) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports .
The measure , sponsored by Sen . Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ), would clarify the definition of " industry " in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U . S . producers .
Grassley ' s bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh , chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U . S . producers .
The bill ' s proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork .
FED ' S JOHNSON SAYS FED ACTED TO STABILIZE DOLLAR Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the dollar has stabilized against other currencies after action taken by the Fed .
" We have taken the appropriate action and the dollar has stabilized ," Johnson said after testifying to a House Banking subcommittee .
He did not elaborate on the nature of the action nor when it was taken , but said that it was in the spirit of the agreement reached by six industrial nations in Paris recently .
Johnson said the dollar ' s decline against other currencies such as the Japanese yen has been gradual .
Since the accord by the United States , Britain , West Germany , Japan , France and Canada , foreign exchange markets have been closely watching for indications of intervention by central banks to determine the committment by those nations to their agreement .
The nations agreed that currency exchange rates were at about the correct levels when the pact was signed earlier this year .
MARYLAND NATIONAL & lt ; MDNT > SEES NEW NAME Maryland National Corp , the parent of Maryland National Bank which earlier this month merged with American Security Bank , said its shareholders will vote on a new name for the regional bank holding company at its April 29 annual meeting .

The banks merged on March 16 , and have combined assets of about 14 billion dlrs .
Maryland said the new name only will be used for the parent and it does not plan to change the names of Maryland National Bank , American Security Bank or non - bank affiliates .
VENEZUELA TO ANNOUCE PARTNER FOR COAL VENTURE Petroleos de Venezuela S . A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state , PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said .
Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project , which the state oil company will manage .
PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone , a subsidiary of Italy ' s Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi ( ENI ), and Atlantic Richfield & lt ; ARC > of the United States .
Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of the contract with the foreign partner .
PDVSA vice - president Pablo Reimpell said last week the first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be made during the final quarter of 1987 , and would measure between 100 - 150 , 000 metric tons .
Plans call for production to eventually reach 500 , 000 mt annually .
Reimpell said the original investment in the project will be approximately 8 billion bolivars .

U . S . SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED , CONGRESSMAN SAYS The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987 , Jerry Huckaby , a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview .
Huckaby , a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program , indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U . S . sugar imports this year .
" With imports coming down from 1 . 8 mln ( last year ) to one mln , there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines ," Huckaby said .
By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports , the quota would effectively be eased by about 250 , 000 tons .
Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period " we could get away without having to increase the quota .
" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified .
Earlier this month , representatives of U . S . cane sugar refiners met with U . S . Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200 , 000 tons .
The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U . S later this year , a refiner spokesman said .
However , the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request .
Following the refiners ' request , representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion , industry sources said .
The statement by Huckaby , who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program , indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota , industry officials said .
Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration ' s interagency sugar policy group .
Asked about possible quota changes , A USDA official said " As far as I know , changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration .
"
CALIFORNIA MICROWAVE & lt ; CMIC > TAKES 3RD QTR CHARGE California Microwave Inc said it will take non - recurring charges of 9 . 7 mln dlrs to pre - tax earnings in the third quarter ended March 31 .
The company said earnings from operations in the second half , ending June 30 , 1987 , excluding the charges , are expected to be in the break - even range .
In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2 , 297 , 000 dlrs , or 29 cts per share .

CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U . S . POTASH ACTION External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U . S . action against Canadian potash exports , but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute .
In the latest flashpoint in Canadian - U . S . trade relations , the U . S . International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U . S . dlrs last year were injuring the U . S . industry .
" We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected ," Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period .
But he said the opposition parties should be careful " not to raise false alarms too early .
" The case now goes before the U . S . Commerce Department ' s trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed .
Potash producers from New Mexico , claiming unfair government subsidies , are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada ' s shipments .
Canada , the world ' s largest potash producer , exported 9 . 8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year , with nearly a third going to the U . S .
Most of the potash , used in the production of fertilizer , comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan .
In the Commons , Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another " trade harrassment " from the U . S . and criticized Clark ' s assurances the country ' s interests would be protected .
" We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled ," Axworthy said .
Canada ' s Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U . S . Axworthy urged the government to present Canada ' s case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U . S . " What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system ," Clark said .
Meanwhile , Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case , claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies .
" The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide ," he said .
" It ' s caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer , whether it ' s potash fertilizer , nitrogen fertilizer or whatever .

MERGERS , PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS Automobile dealerships have become large , multi - store operations , and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year .
Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships , and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public , analysts say .
Retail car sales " are at a point of transition .
There ' s not much that ' s off the table in terms of creative thinking " about ways to sell cars , says David Cole , analyst with the University of Michigan ' s Transportation Research Institute .
The retail car market is " much more freeform now " than it was in 1956 , the year things began to change , says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates .
Thirty years ago , in 1956 , the situation was different .
Dealerships sold one kind of car -- a " Chevy " or a Ford or a Studebaker .
The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738 , 000 dlrs worth of vehicles , according to the National Automobile Dealers Association .
That year a tiny car from overseas -- Germany ' s Volkswagen Beatle -- began to gain popularity .
The " Bug " caused " a rebellion " among dealers , who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers , says Jauppi .
One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships , auto analysts say .
Last year , the average dealership had 11 . 2 mln dlrs in sales -- a 15 - fold increase from 1956 -- and employed 34 workers .
" I had one of these guys tell me he makes six , seven mln dlrs a year and didn ' t know what to do with all his money ," says Cole .
" There ' s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars ," he says .
With the increase in size , large dealers have been buying up other dealerships , and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up .
Donald Keithley , vice president , dealer services , for J . D .
Power , a California - based market research firm , says that , by 1990 , 12 , 000 people will own dealerships compared to 16 , 800 principal owners today .
Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises , some of which might compete against each other .
" It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer .
Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines ," Jauppi says .
As dealers get bigger , industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly - owned or open international operations .
Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers , " are obviously thinking of very seriously ," says Cole .
Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering , Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares .
" Dealers are large enough now to go public .
The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars .
It could happen any time ," Jauppi says .
" If you look at the whole merger mania , and look at the scale some of these dealers , it ' s going to be very hard to resist taking them public ," said another analyst .
And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international .
" We ' re going to have international dealers -- dealer networks that are worldwide ," he says .
U . S . dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe , where the market will expand faster than the U . S ., he says .
" It ' s not totally off the wall ," says Cole .

JAPAN BUYS MODEST AMOUNT OF DOLLARS , DEALERS SAY The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning , possibly around 200 to 300 mln , dealers said .
One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks .
The buying began when the dollar was at about 149 . 60 yen , and helped drive the U . S . Currency up to around 150 , he said .
Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen .
But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen , dealers said .
JAPAN ' S 1986 / 87 SUGAR CANE OUTPUT SEEN FALLING An Agriculture Ministry survey has estimated the nation ' s 1986 / 87 crop sugar cane output at 2 . 14 mln tonnes , down from 2 . 62 mln a year earlier .
Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season , which totals 34 , 800 hectares , down from 35 , 700 in 1985 / 86 , they said .
Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987 Japan ' s final output will be announced at the beginning of June , they said .

Bank of Japan keeps intervening to hold dollar above 149 yen , brokers
JAPAN INTERVENING TO KEEP DOLLAR UP , BROKERS The Bank of Japan is continuing to intervene in the Tokyo market , buying small amounts of dollars to hold the unit above 149 yen , brokers said .
They said the Bank is coming in when the dollar is around 149 . 05 / 10 yen , the same levels as New York ' s close yesterday and the midday close in Tokyo today .
Dealers said the Bank of Japan is intervening in the market through both banks and brokers this afternoon .
The central bank is checking selling orders through banks and placing matching buy orders , they said .
The central bank started to intervene shortly after the market opened here in the afternoon , the dealers said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 350 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 350 mln stg in the money market today .
Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take - up of treasury bills will drain some 525 mln stg while bankers ' balnces below target will take out around 175 mln stg .
Partly offsetting these outflows , exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40 mln stg to the system respectively .

THAILAND ' S FOREIGN RESERVES FALL IN FEBRUARY Thailand ' s foreign reserves of gold , special drawing rights and convertible currencies fell to 3 . 86 billion dlrs at end - February from 3 . 95 billion the previous month , but were above the 3 . 08 billion held at the same time last year , the Bank of Thailand said .
It said the reserves were equal to about five months ' worth of imports .
EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G - 6 LEVELS - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris .
Asked whether a dollar / yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals , he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals .
Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement , which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end .
He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary , adding he did not think a dollar free - fall was likely .
But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals .
In Paris on February 22 , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels .
Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday .
But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions .
U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar .
U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U . S / Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained .
The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid - January , Sumita said .
He added he does not expect the yen / dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen .
The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord , he added .

Sumita says Bank of Japan has no intention of lowering its discount rate
JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen ' s rise .
He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high .
The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance , such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices , he said .
Although the yen ' s rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy , the economy is not likely to slow down much further , Sumita said .
" I don ' t think we should change our economic outlook at the moment ," Sumita said .
Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year .
The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month ' s pact on currency stability when they meet next in April .
Dealers said they expect the six - Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF / World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9 .
JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986 A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd & lt ; JARD . HKG > to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986 , stock analysts said .
They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H . K .
Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985 .
The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985 .
James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson ' s 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales .
Analysts said the group ' s 7 - Eleven retail stores and its franchises , among them Canon cameras , Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars , produced a strong cash flow .
Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson ' s 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre - tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985 .
But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson ' s earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd & lt ; HKLD . HKG > will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985 .
The reduced contribution reflects the spin - off from Hong Kong Land of & lt ; Dairy Farm International Ltd > last September .
Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin - off .
Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business , which will increase its overall retail income figures .
Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services , mainly its 50 pct share of & lt ; Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd >.
Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209 . 5 mln dlrs against 104 . 7 mln in 1985 .
Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year , slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985 , while the company ' s term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2 . 7 billion dlrs .
But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985 , they said .
Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests .
It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created & lt ; Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd > in which it has a 41 pct interest .
A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt , leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand .
Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high - yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units , it is likely to develop its own business , analysts said .
" The future of the stock will depend on the firm ' s ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions ," said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett .
He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector , and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business .
CHINA ' S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT China ' s first joint venture bank , Xiamen International Bank ( XIB ), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 , the bank ' s first full year of operation .
General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast , saying targets were under study .
Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group ' s outstanding loans at end - 1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs , up from 530 mln at end - 1985 .
Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln , he told Reuters .
Liu said most of the group ' s profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly - owned subsidiaries & lt ; Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd > in Hong Kong and & lt ; Luso International Bank Ltd > in Macao .
The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986 .
Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner , Hong Kong - listed & lt ; Panin Holdings Ltd >, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct .
This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB ' s reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake , he said .
Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded , but he did not elaborate .
Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1 . 99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268 , 000 dlrs in 1985 .
The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , Fujian branch , whose share rose to 23 . 5 pct from 15 , Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17 . 5 pct ( 15 ) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct ( 10 ).
One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state - owned banks .
The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated , he added .
Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners .
But the foreign banker , who asked not to be named , said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank .
Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state - owned Agricultural Bank of China , Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices , mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks .
BANGLADESH ' S PAYMENTS DEFICIT NARROWS IN OCTOBER Bangladesh recorded an overall balance of payments deficit of 8 . 3 mln U . S . Dlrs in October against a 10 . 33 mln deficit in September and a 6 . 67 mln surplus in October 1985 , Central Bank officials said .
The country ' s current account deficit narrowed to 10 . 69 mln dlrs in October from 79 mln in September and 11 . 75 mln in October 1985 .
The October trade deficit narrowed to 36 . 36 mln dlrs from 160 mln in September and 83 . 79 mln in October 1985 .
TWO JAPANESE STEELMAKERS TO CUT CAPITAL SPENDING Nippon Steel Corp & lt ; NSTC . TOK > said it will cut its capital spending by 36 . 4 pct to 105 billion yen in the year starting April 1 from a year earlier due to the postponement of furnace improvements .

YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DOLLAR , NIKKEIREN SAYS The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar , a leading Japanese businessman said .
Bumpei Otsuki , president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers ' Associations , ( Nikkeiren ), told reporters : " The yen might rise as far as 140 ( to the dollar ).
The U . S . Economy is not good , and as long as the U . S . Economy is not good , the U . S . Will put various pressures ( on Japan ).
" " The yen ' s level depends on the condition of the U . S . Economy rather than Japan ' s economy , and as long as the American situation is bad , the yen will continue to rise ," he said .
To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen , Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means , including holding down wages as much as possible , Otsuki said .
He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand .
" We have to keep wages as low as possible ," he said .
He also said the yen ' s large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy , noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports .
Parts of the service sector are also threatened , Otsuki said .
Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries , he said .
It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector , he said .
Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988 , leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy , he said .
Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986 .
The government ' s Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2 . 5 pct in 1986 , the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1 . 4 pct due to the first oil price crisis .
In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy , tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation ' s housing stock are needed , along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities , he said .
SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES EASE Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates eased across the board in a dull market which was long in day - to - day funds , dealers said .
Today ' s quiet market continued a lull of several days in which traders were said to be waiting on the sidelines ahead of further clues to the direction of oil prices and the Saudi economy .
Dealers cited some borrowing interest in two , three , and six - month deposits but said activity focused on short dates and one - month deposits as banks tried to lend surplus funds .
Spot - next was put at 5 - 3 / 4 , 5 - 1 / 4 pct , down from six , 5 - 1 / 2 yesterday while one - week rates were steady at six , 5 - 1 / 2 pct .
One - month deposits declined to 6 - 1 / 4 , 1 / 8 pct from 6 - 1 / 2 , 1 / 4 on Monday , while three months was barely changed at seven , 6 - 15 / 16 pct .
The spot riyal was little changed at 3 . 7501 / 03 to the dollar after quotes of 3 . 7498 / 7501 yesterday .

VIETNAM TO RESETTLE 300 , 000 ON STATE FARMS IN 1987 Vietnam will resettle 300 , 000 people on state farms known as new economic zones in 1987 , to create jobs and grow more high - value export crops , the communist party newspaper Nhan Dan said .
Yesterday ' s edition , received here today , said Vietnam would invest one billion dong , including the costs of relocation , in 272 new economic zones .
About one third of that sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee , tea , rubber and pepper in the Central Highlands , it said .
Since 1975 , Vietnam has resettled about three million people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones .
MADAGASCAR EXTENDS AMOCO OIL EXPLORATION AGREEMENT Madagascar extended its oil exploration agreement with the U . S . Firm Amoco Corp & lt ; AN > for 17 months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on the southwest coast , a government statement said .
It said the existing five - year agreement , due to expire this July 24 , was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies .
Amoco has so far laid 7 , 100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin .
It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period , the statement said .
Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981 .
But despite promising indications of large reserves , no commercial production plans have yet been announced .
The foreign firms - Amoco , Occidental Petroleum Corp & lt ; OXY >, Mobil Corp & lt ; MOB > and a unit of & lt ; Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi > - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries ( OMNIS ).
Roland Ratsimandresy , the director general of OMNIS , said at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement that his department would intensify oil exploration with its existing partners and would soon offer a new round of exploration licences .
FERRUZZI DEAL WITH CPC WORTH 630 MLN DLRS The Ferruzzi Group ' s holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies , a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said .
When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York , it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs .
Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations .
It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5 , 000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states .
The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1 . 6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by - products a year , or about one third of EC production , from about 2 . 7 mln tonnes of cereals .
Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro - industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products .
It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake , and the major cereal trader .
It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas , of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share , and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future , notably in the production of ethanol for fuel .
Raul Gardini , president of the Ferruzzi Group , said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts .

SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1 , senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters .
They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised .
" The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock ," a senior official said .
He said the government has finalised an agreement with E . D . F . Man ( Sugar ) Ltd under which E . D . F . Man will hold a buffer stock on the government ' s behalf of 20 , 000 tonnes , against the 45 , 000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department .
Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks .
The agreement with E . D . F .
Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms , they said .
Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance .
The Department and the private sector each imported around 115 , 000 tonnes of sugar last year , when national consumption was 280 , 000 tonnes .
An Importers Association official said that " even if the Department no longer imports sugar , we would not necessarily buy more .
" This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment ( CWE ), he said .
The CWE is a semi - government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it , starting April 1 .
Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E . D . F .
For the past two years .

The new advances for the period March 25 to April 4 , replace current 5 . 3 pct , five day advances totalling 4 . 003 billion guilders which expire today .
Money brokers said yesterday they expected the Bank to allocate about 3 . 5 billion guilders .

JAPAN ASKS TRADERS , EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES The Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling , trading house officials said .
The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy .
It made the request by telephone .
A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters .
But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling .
The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy .
The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely .
A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149 . 98 on January 19 .
It hit a new record low of 148 . 20 yen yesterday .
He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall .
MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business , which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London .
The 14th congress of the Inter - Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade .
Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues , and the slide of the Lebanese pound , can be expected to be major talking points .
About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non - Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday .
Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market , by far the largest in the region , is being carried out in London .
The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia ' s 11 banks , foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain .
But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain - based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London .
As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined , many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations .
None of the four major U . K . Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island .
The two major Bahrain - based international banks , & lt ; Arab Banking Corp > and & lt ; Gulf International Bank BSC > have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing .
One economist said : " It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain ...
There is now the nucleus of a two - way market in London .
" Jeddah - based & lt ; Riyad Bank > set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984 , while its main rival in Saudi Arabia , & lt ; National Commercial Bank > ( NCB ) won a licence in November 1986 .
The major market maker has traditionally been London - based consortium bank & lt ; Saudi International Bank > but the kingdom joint - venture & lt ; Saudi American Bank > ( SAMBA ) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid - February .
One senior currency trader in Riyadh said : " Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA , but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia .
" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify .
Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks , most in Saudi riyals , dropped to the equivalent of 12 . 2 billion dlrs at end - September 1986 from 13 . 4 billion at end - 1985 and a 1983 peak of 15 . 0 billion .
The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits .
Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday , the Gulf weekend .
Traders also expect & lt ; Arab National Bank > to step up London operations .
Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region , partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency ' s ( SAMA ) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation .
There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited .
But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon .
Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates .
But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC ' s annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year .
One dealer said : " A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced .
But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go - ahead .
" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies .
The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC .
The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U . S . Dollar .
Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies , but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7 - 1 / 4 pct , large enough to avoid sudden strains .
Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks .
BELGOLUX TRADE SWINGS INTO JANUARY DEFICIT The Belgo - Luxembourg Economic Union recorded a provisional trade deficit of 9 . 45 billion francs in January after a December surplus of 15 . 32 billion francs , revised upwards from a provisional surplus of 11 . 94 billion , the National Statistics Office said .
In January 1986 , the union recorded a deficit of 23 . 31 billion francs .
January imports fell to a provisional 228 . 86 billion francs from 240 . 24 billion in December and 281 . 65 billion a year earlier , but exports were also lower , at 219 . 41 billion francs against 255 . 56 billion and 258 . 34 billion respectively .
GUINNESS SEEKS U . K .
INJUNCTION AGAINST SAUNDERS Guinness Plc & lt ; GUIN . L > will seek an injunction in the U . K . High Court today to freeze the assets of former Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5 . 2 mln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company ' s takeover battle for & lt ; Distillers Co Plc >, a spokesman said .
He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders ' assets up to the value of the sum it wanted to recover .
It was uncertain whether the court would reach any decision on the request today .
Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action to recover the funds , paid to non - executive director Thomas Ward via the Jersey company .
Lawyers representing Ward have said he saw the funds as his reward for services performed during the takeover of Distillers .
Guinness is also planning a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove both Saunders and Ward from the company ' s board .
BASF U . S . PROFIT , TURNOVER BOOSTED BY ACQUISITIONS BASF AG & lt ; BASF . F > said net profit of its U . S . Operating company , BASF Corp , rose last calendar year to 105 mln dlrs from 39 mln in 1985 .
Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3 . 6 billion , the parent company said in a statement .
The rise , however , partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985 .
Excluding these , BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985 .
Acquisitions were the high - performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp , Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV & lt ; AKZO . AS >.
BASF said it expected a U . S . Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987 , part of a five - year programme totalling one billion .
U . S .
Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic acid plant in Freeport , Texas , a technical centre in Southfield , Michigan , in which paint lines from automotive plants can be refitted , and the new agricultural research centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham , North Carolina .
BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar , Louisiana , on plants for production of special amines and polytetrahydrofuran , as well as for expansion of capacity for producing tetrahydrofuran .

TAIWAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES 48 . 22 PCT IN YEAR Taiwan ' s M - 1B money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 48 . 22 pct in the year to end - February , after rising 54 . 96 pct in the year to January , a central bank spokesman said .
Month on month , M1 - B fell 5 . 19 pct from January .
Unadjusted February M1 - B was 1 , 168 billion dlrs against 1 , 232 billion in January and 788 billion in February 1986 .
Money supply grew faster in January because the central bank issued more currency for bonus payments made to workers at the Lunar New Year , which fell on January 29 this year , banking sources said .
PEMEX SIGNS 500 MLN DLR JAPAN LOAN FOR PIPELINE Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the Export - Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project , Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said .
No further details on the loan were immediately available .
Ayala told an oil seminar the project , due for completion in 1988 , is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market , mainly along the Pacific coast .
The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast , and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery .
The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas ( LPG ) storage tanks at Santa Cruz , additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline , an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz , Ayala said .
Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project , he said .
The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico ' s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico .
Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product , he added .
NIPPON STEEL TO REDUCE DIVIDEND Nippon Steel Corp & lt ; NSTC . T > plans to reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31 1987 from the five yen of 1985 / 86 , a company spokesman said .
The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986 / 87 , including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities .
This compares with a 36 . 07 billion yen profit a year earlier .
Sales in 1986 / 87 are seen at 2 , 150 billion yen , down from 2 , 685 billion a year ago .
Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen ' s rise and slow world steel demand .
Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May .
Total 1986 / 87 crude steel production is estimated at 25 . 57 mln tonnes , down from 27 . 98 mln a year earlier .
Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986 / 87 output but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April 1 are unavailable yet , he said .
BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc ' s & lt ; BTI . L > major sectors enabled the group ' s 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running , Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement .
The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1 . 39 billion , which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions .
Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper .
Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume .
The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT .
BAT said the U . S . Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms .
Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth .
Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg .
BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter .
Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U . K . Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1 . 03 billion .
Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half .
Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct .
The net ratio , at 26 pct , left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development .
Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg , nearly three times the 1982 level , with Wiggins Teape ' s sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg .
BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U . S . For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg .
TAIWAN SEES ITS INVESTMENT IN U . S .
RISING SHARPLY Taiwanese investment in the U . S . Is expected to nearly double to 80 mln U . S . Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991 , a five - year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed .
Taiwanese investment in the U . S . Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs , the ministry document said .
The investment was mainly in electronics , trading , food and service industries .
Lee Ming - Yi , deputy director of the ministry ' s Industrial Development and Investment Centre , said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad .
Lee told Reuters the incentives , to be introduced in May or June , include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U . S . To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln .
He said the moves to encourage investment in the U . S . Are part of Taiwan ' s efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington , which rose to a record 13 . 6 billion U . S . Dlrs in 1986 from 1985 ' s 10 . 2 billion .
Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U . S ., He added .

PLACER PACIFIC SAYS BIG BELL GOLD STUDY EXPANDING & lt ; Placer Pacific Ltd > said it will undertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia ' s Big Bell gold prospect .
Results of an economic evaluation of the find , in which Placer has an option with & lt ; Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd > ( ACM ) to earn a 50 pct interest , were encouraging enough to warrant a full study , Placer said in a statement .
Big Bell , in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of Perth , was founded in 1904 .
Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22 . 8 tonnes of gold and 7 . 8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30 , 000 tonnes of ore a month .
Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three - gram - per - tonne concentration accessible by open - pit mining and a further 4 . 5 mln tonnes with a 4 . 4 - gram - a - tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground .
It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell .
If the results are positive and a commitment to develop made then construction would take about 12 months , Placer said .

CHINA TO TIGHTEN IMPORT CONTROL , CUT EXPORT COSTS China should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically , Premier Zhao Ziyang said .
He told the National People ' s Congress , China ' s parliament , that the country ' s foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed .
" We should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion ," he said .
On exports , China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods , especially textiles , light industrial goods , electronics and machinery , he said .
Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss .
In 1986 China had a trade deficit of 11 . 9 billion dlrs , down from a record 14 billion in 1985 .
Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen .
It should use foreign funds for production and construction , with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes .
China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad , he added .

KLOECKNER UND CO ' S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT Kloeckner & amp ; Co KGaA , the international trading group , said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985 , adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves .
The company , which gave no 1986 profit figures , posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985 .
It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write - back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises .
These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices .
Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar .
It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital , which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations .
Kloeckner ' s nominal 100 mark profit - participation certificates , issued in October 1986 , will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct .
Holders of the certificates are entitled to a quarter of the 1986 payment , or around 2 . 50 marks , the company added .
MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development , according to views polled by Reuter correspondents .
Officials in Malaysia , Indonesia and Thailand , which produce the bulk of the world ' s rubber , said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long - term .
But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises .
The new INRA , to replace the current one which expires on October 22 , was formally adopted by most of the world ' s producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday .
It will be open for signature at the U . N . Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports .
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360 , 000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices .
He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system .
Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400 , 000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150 , 000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members , he said .
Under the existing pact , members can borrow from banks to finance INRA ' s buffer stock purchases .
This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse , like the International Tin Agreement .
" This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance ," Lim said .
Malaysia , the world ' s largest producer , was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members , he said .
Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia ' s rubber industry ' s by stabilising prices .
It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened , they said .
Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations .
Malaysian growers , however , said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers .
" With the INRA ' s ability to keep prices at a certain stable level , consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price , while producers may never see sharp price rises ," a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters .
Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360 , 000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises , he said .
State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA ' s inception and the creation of a buffer stock , and they seemed unlikely to rise .
Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock , they added .
Traders in the region , meanwhile , said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more .
Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact ' s conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future .
" The 360 , 000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned ," a Malaysian trader said .
Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it , but they questioned the ability of some financially - strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations .
CIBA - GEIGY , PHILLIPS PETROLEUM IN JOINT VENTURE Ciba - Geigy AG & lt ; CIGZ . Z > said it would establish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co .

Polyphenylene sulfide is widely used in the electronic , automotive , and petroleum fields .
KRUPP TO BUILD SOUTH KOREAN STEEL PLANT Fried .
Krupp GmbH said its Krupp Industrietechnik GmbH subsidiary has won a 130 mln marks joint order with Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Co . Ltd of Seoul for a steel works in Pohang , South Korea .
It said the order , awarded by the Pohang Iron and Steel Co . Ltd , involves a works due to go on stream in 1989 producing 250 , 000 tonnes of non - corrosive quality steels annually .
The consortium partners will supply the plant , supervise its construction and advise on product processing , with Krupp providing a 100 - tonne capacity arc furnace and a converter for steel refining .
The West German company will supply ladles , vehicles , electrical and exhaust cooling apparatus and dust filters .
It will also fit out the plant ' s laboratory .
Among other things Krupp said it will provide know - how for all production phases and train the Korean workforce .
It said Samsung will take care of the Korean part of the engineering and electrical work , the water treatment and other mechanical equipment , according to Krupp basic engineering .
Extruded ingots from the plant will be converted to sheet in an existing hot rolling mill .
The sheet will be processed in facilities which are to be erected , Krupp said .
SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR Swire Pacific Ltd & lt ; SWPC . HKG > expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector , chairman Michael Miles said .
He told reporters :" 1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year ... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio .
" He did not give any specific projections for earnings .
The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1 . 78 billion H . K .
Dlrs from a year ago .
Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1 . 38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15 . 25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd & lt ; CAPH . HKG >.
Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business , primarily in Hong Kong .
Swire ' s stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54 . 25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated , and then cut to 50 . 25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state - owned & lt ; China International Trust and Investment Corp >.
Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1 . 23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago .
Miles said despite last year ' s rapid expansion in Cathay ' s flights and fleet , load factor is still holding up at 70 pct .
He said Cathay ' s growth last year was the result of " a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs .
" " At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year ," he said , " though there might be a bit of increase later this year .
'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations , even though the marine sector is generally depressed .
" Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better ," he said .
The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864 . 4 mln dlrs the previous year .
Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion .
He said the company ' s 50 pct unit & lt ; Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd > is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate .
" But it ' s not as big as Taikoo Shing ," he said .
UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT - TRADE Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of today ' s EC white sugar tender , traders here said , noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to move over 800 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention .
They said that due to the dispute between the Commission and producers over the issue , it is not clear whether the Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences on a large tonnage .
The subsidy is seen being set above 45 . 00 Ecus per 100 kilos , although traders are reluctant to predict a precise level after prices fell yesterday .
Earlier , traders in Paris said they expected the Commission to award licences for around 50 , 000 tonnes of white sugar with a maximum export rebate of 45 . 75 to 46 . 0 Ecus .
Last week , the Commission granted licences to end August on 60 , 500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44 . 819 .
ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID Abu Dhabi ' s offshore Abu al - Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf , shut since an aerial attack last November , will reopen when new anti - aircraft defences are ready , and this could be in the next two months , oil industry sources said .
They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ( Total ) & lt ; TPN . PA >, whose Total Abu al - Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field , have agreed on the reopening , but that a date has not been definitely fixed .
Unidentified planes hit the field , 100 miles off Abu Dhabi , last November 25 .
The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform .
Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq .
Abu al - Bukhoosh was producing 57 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) at the time of the attack , but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable .
The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations , the sources said .
Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment , anti - aircraft missiles , housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads , the sources said .
Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates , accounting for about 800 , 000 bpd of its total 1 . 15 mln bpd production , the sources said .
They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field , part of the same reservoir as Abu al - Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away .
Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al - Bukhoosh was attacked .
COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS Comalco Ltd & lt ; CMAC . S > said its return to profit reflected reduced costs , improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture .
It said the earlier reported 57 . 1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69 . 13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U . S . Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium .
Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final , dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws .
This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985 .
Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity , though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings .
Withdrawal from the & lt ; Showa Aluminium Industries KK > joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the & lt ; New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd > project with Japan ' s & lt ; Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd >, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs , it said .
As previously reported Comalco ' s & lt ; Commonwealth Aluminium Corp > unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale , Washington , and port facilities at Portland , Oregon to & lt ; Columbia Aluminium Corp >.
Comalco said it had made a 27 . 3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts .
The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140 . 5 mln dlrs were a 102 . 9 mln write - off of unrealised exchange losses and 10 . 3 mln for an increase in future tax provision .
RAINBOW LIFTS PROGRESSIVE STAKE TO 52 PCT & lt ; Rainbow Corp Ltd > said it has lifted its stake in supermarket group & lt ; Progressive Enterprises Ltd > to 52 pct from 44 pct .
It said in a statement it has bought an extra 9 . 4 mln shares at prices ranging from 3 . 80 N . Z .
Dlrs to 4 . 80 .
Progressive is currently the subject of both a proposed merger with Rainbow and a full takeover bid from & lt ; Brierley Investments Ltd > ( BIL ).
The BIL bid , launched on Monday , is at 4 . 20 dlrs a share .
The Rainbow merger involves shareholders in both Rainbow and Progressive being issued shares in a new company , & lt ; Astral Pacific Corp Ltd >, on a one - for - one basis .
Rainbow chief executive Craig Heatley said , " In our opinion BIL ' s actions over the last few days have been undertaken for their own strategic purposes which conflict with the desire of both companies to merge their interests .
" BIL has said it is against the merger because it sees Progressive shares as being worth twice as as much as Rainbow ' s .
Progressive traded today at 4 . 42 , Rainbow at 3 . 66 and BIL at 4 . 30 at the end of morning trading on the New Zealand Stock Exchange .
YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DLR , NIKKEIREN SAYS The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar , a leading Japanese businessman said .
Bumpei Otsuki , president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers ' Associations , ( Nikkeiren ), told reporters : " The yen might rise as far as 140 ( to the dollar ).
The U . S . Economy is not good , and as long as the U . S . Economy is not good , the U . S . Will put various pressures ( on Japan ).
" " The yen ' s level depends on the condition of the U . S . Economy rather than Japan ' s economy , and as long as the American situation is bad , the yen will continue to rise ," he said .
To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen , Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means , including holding down wages as much as possible , Otsuki said .
He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand .
" We have to keep wages as low as possible ," he said .
He also said the yen ' s large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy , noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports .
Parts of the service sector are also threatened , Otsuki said .
Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries , he said .
It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector , he said .
Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988 , leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy , he said .
Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986 .
The government ' s Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2 . 5 pct in 1986 , the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1 . 4 pct due to the first oil price crisis .
In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy , tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation ' s housing stock are needed , along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities , he said .
JAPAN BUYS MODEST AMOUNT OF DOLLARS , DEALERS SAY The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning , possibly around 200 to 300 mln , dealers said .
One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks .
The buying began when the dollar was at about 149 . 60 yen , and helped drive the U . S . Currency up to around 150 , he said .
Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen .
But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen , dealers said .
JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen ' s rise .
He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high .
The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance , such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices , he said .
Although the yen ' s rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy , the economy is not likely to slow down much further , Sumita said .
" I don ' t think we should change our economic outlook at the moment ," Sumita said .
Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year .
The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month ' s pact on currency stability when they meet next in April .
Dealers said they expect the six - Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF / World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9 .
U . K . MONEY MARKET FORECAST REVISED TO SHOW SURPLUS The Bank of England said it had revised its forecast of the liquidity position in the money market today to a surplus of 150 mln stg after it estimated a flat position earlier this morning .
BANK OF ENGLAND DOES NOT OPERATE IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it had not operated in the money market during the morning session .
Earlier , the Bank revised its forecast of the liquidity position in the system today to a surplus of 150 mln stg from its original estimate of a flat position .
CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS CRA Ltd & lt ; CRAA . S > said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1 , making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985 .
The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138 . 2 mln dlrs from 87 . 8 mln in 1985 , against analysts ' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln .
CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders .
After July 1 , dividends will be tax - free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid .
The company operates on a substituted tax year , not the fiscal year ending June 30 , and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings , CRA said in a statement .
Consequently , it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout , it said .
Despite the higher net earnings , CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry , with the notable exception of gold producers .
Prices for major metals expressed in real U . S .
Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years , it said .
Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty , while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry , CRA said .
World demand for metals is growing slowly .
Inventories have steadily declined , with supply and demand in better balance , but overcapacity continues , CRA said .
Turning to contributions to its earnings , CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd & lt ; BUVA . S > contributed 31 . 3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd ' s & lt ; CMAC . S > net was 37 . 8 mln .
Net earnings from iron - ore operations were 111 . 8 mln dlrs against 149 . 2 mln in 1985 , it said .
Lead , zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66 . 8 mln dlrs against a 38 . 1 mln loss in 1985 , CRA said .
Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36 . 7 mln dlrs against 34 . 1 mln , while salt raised its contribution to 4 . 7 mln from 2 . 8 mln .
CRA ' s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12 . 0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985 .
CRA said the main item in its 250 . 28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172 . 9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard .
Other extraordinary items were 63 . 3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14 . 1 mln increase in future tax provisions , CRA said .
Cash flow continued at a high level , being 950 . 6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1 . 02 billion in 1985 .
The strong cash flow , coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances , enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs .
CRA said it held forward contracts at year - end to buy 985 mln U . S . Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt .
This cost 47 . 0 mln dlrs after tax , included in the net interest cost .
EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G - 6 LEVELS - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris .
Asked whether a dollar / yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals , he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals .
Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement , which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end .
He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary , adding he did not think a dollar free - fall was likely .
But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals .
In Paris on February 22 , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels .
Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday .
But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions .
U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar .
U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U . S / Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained .
The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid - January , Sumita said .
He added he does not expect the yen / dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen .
The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord , he added .
JAPAN ASKS TRADERS , EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES The Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling , trading house officials said .
The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy .
It made the request by telephone .
A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters .
But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling .
The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy .
The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely .
A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149 . 98 on January 19 .
It hit a new record low of 148 . 20 yen yesterday .
He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall .
CENTRAL BANKS BUY DOLLARS FOR YEN IN LONDON The Bank of Japan intervened to stem strong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this morning , dealers said .
The Bank of Japan here declined comment .
The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment .
Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148 . 65 yen , holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148 . 80 .
The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday , but it gave no confirmation .
Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar , but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen .
Selling during the London trading morning was largely attributed to Japanese institutions .
Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of Japan action this morning .
One U . S . Bank trader said it could have been up to 500 mln dlrs , but said this was largely a guess .

CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U . S . China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports , to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology .
But the U . S . Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U . S . Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports .
The official International Business newspaper today published China ' s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U . S . Secretary of State George Shultz .
" It is extremely important that the U . S . Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports , provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports ," the editorial said .
" The U . S . Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference ( GSP ).
" Despite easing of curbs on U . S . Technology exports in recent years , control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries ," it added The paper also printed an article by China ' s commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy , Chen Shibiao , who said that " all kinds of difficulties and restrictions " were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential .
He named them as U . S .
Protectionist behaviour , curbs on technology transfer and out - of - date trade legislation .
The paper also printed a table showing that , since bilateral trade began in 1972 , China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977 .
It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2 . 09 billion and 1 . 722 billion dlrs .
A U . S . Embassy official said the U . S . Did not accept Peking ' s trade figures at all , mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans - shipped to U . S .
While U . S .
Figures are based on country of origin .
He said that , if China wants to obtain GSP status , it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status .
The U . S . Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP , China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), for which it applied in July 1986 , and " not be dominated or controlled by international Communism .
" The official said China was well aware of the laws , some of which date to the anti - Communist early 1950 ' s , but that there is not sufficient political will in the U . S . To change them .
China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti - dumping in the U . S .
Within the last two years , which the U . S . Side won , he said .
But , for the first time , China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods , which may lead the U . S . Side to withdraw the anti - dumping case , he added .
Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking ' s application to GATT .
" China has the potential to disrupt world markets , especially in textiles .
Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect .
But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT ," the diplomat said .
Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China ' s massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports .
In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian , U . S . Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China ' s interest in participating in GATT .
" The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type ," Shultz said .
" China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide .
China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation ," he said .
The problems facing U . S .- China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs , especially for exports , and a de facto dual currency system .
In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month , China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with " guidance planning " and economic levers .
The diplomat said that , to join GATT , China had much to do .

OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia - Pacific region for oil production , energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here .
The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s , he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference .
Fesharaki , leader of the Energy Program at the East - West Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , was speaking on the Asia - Pacific petroleum outlook .
With domestic demand of around 12 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) and prospects of production of over 100 , 000 bpd by late 1991 , PNG would become an Ecuador - level crude exporter , Fesharaki said .
The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG .
The PNG government ' s Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels .
PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes , Fesharaki said .
" We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea , and discovery of much larger volumes of oil , similar in quality to ( light ) Bass Strait crude ," Fesharaki said .
There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced , notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 bpd , he said .
But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field , he said .
The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little - explored sedimentary basins in PNG .

NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday , as exchange rates and short - term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks , money market dealers said .
Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow ' s tender for a securities repurchase pact , from which funds will be credited on Thursday , when an earlier pact expires , draining 16 billion marks from the system .
The tender was announced last Friday , because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday , and will close banks here this afternoon .
Because of the disruption to business from carnival , minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic , making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender .
Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week ' s pact to keep short - term rates down .
But because of uncertainty about banks ' current holdings , the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week , and top it up if necessary at next week ' s tender .
" I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little , to say 14 or 15 billion marks ," one dealer said .
" They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer ," he added .
An earlier pact expires next week , draining 8 . 5 billion marks from the system .
Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers .
Banks held 52 . 0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank , averaging 51 . 0 billion over the whole month , just clear of the 50 . 5 billion February reserve requirement .
Call money traded today at 3 . 85 / 95 pct , up from 3 . 80 / 90 yesterday .

THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government ' s oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices .
She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea .
" We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies ," she told the Arabic language daily al - Sharq al - Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia .
Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel .
British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future , she said .
" We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries ," Thatcher said .
" On our part , we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility .
"

BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen , dealers said .
The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks , they said .
Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U . S . Federal Reserve were also active yesterday .
The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers ' remarks .
Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month ' s agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability .
One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U . K . Central bank moves .
He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks .
Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1 . 8150 - 1 . 8700 mark range , and above 150 yen , with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks ' resolve to defend currency stability .
But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1 . 81 marks and 150 yen .
Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U . S . Trade deficit were behind the weakness .
This week ' s intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact , dealers said .
Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen .
That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability , they said .
But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were .

KEY U . S . HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U . S . trade laws , chairman Dan Rostenkowski said .
The committee ' s consideration of one of the most controversial provisions , a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States , was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill , its sponsor Rep . Richard Gephardt said .
Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , told Reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take .
Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years , by countries such as Japan .
The Ways and Means Committess ' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U . S . economy .
The trade bill gives U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief .
It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U . S . trading rights .
These powers are currently held by President Reagan .
The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter .
The bill also extends U . S . authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements .
The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April .

SOVIET PAPER DETAILS GEORGIAN FLOOD DAMAGE Floods and avalanches killed 110 people and caused around 350 mln roubles worth of damage in the southern Soviet republic of Georgia earlier this year , the government daily Izvestia said .
Some 80 , 000 hectares of agricultural land and gardens had been inundated , damaging tea plantations and orange groves , the newspaper said .
It added that spring sowing in southern parts of the country was some two weeks behind schedule because of the late thaw but gave no precise crop estimates .
In the most detailed report to date on the heavy snows in January and floods in February , Izvestia said 8 , 200 people had been evacuated from mountain areas , 4 , 500 houses had been damaged and hundreds of kilometres of roads and power lines had been destroyed .
A separate article in the daily warned that a sudden thaw was expected shortly in the Ukraine and southern parts of Russia , which experienced record snows this winter .
Preventive measures have already been taken in some areas including the evacuation of cattle .
UTILICORP & lt ; UCU > SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER Utilicorp United Corp said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about 12 mln dlrs or about 1 . 12 dlrs a share and revenues of about 190 mln dlrs .
In the comparable quarter a year ago , Utilicorp earned 8 . 5 mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs .
There are 9 . 6 mln shares outstanding this year , up from the 8 . 5 mln shares in 1986 , Utilicorp ' s president Richard Green told financial analysts here .
First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution of West Virginia Power , which became a division on March 1 , 1987 , Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts .
Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate increases in Iowa , Minnesota , Kansas and Colorado , he said .
However , Utilicorp ' s Missouri Public Service division is experiencing the effect of a 5 . 9 pct rate reduction authorized in September 1986 , he noted .
Of Utilicorp ' s total revenues expected for the 1987 first quarter , about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas operations , he said .

SOUTH AFRICA PROBLEMS REMAIN DESPITE DEBT PACT South Africa ' s new foreign debt agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets , but bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of anxiety from a still depressed economy .
" We have not gone from ' no confidence ' to ' full confidence ' yet ," commented one banker , who saw the agreement as having marginal influence on fundamental economic problems .
Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and financial rand .
The commercial rand , used for current account transactions , rose 0 . 5 cts to 49 U . S . Cts while the financial rand jumped nearly two cts to 33 U . S . Cts .
All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take place through the financial rand , which is considered the main barometer of South Africa ' s attractiveness to overseas investors .
Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U . S . Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks .
They said the financial rand in particular was being driven by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could favorably affect the currency .
Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan balances and short - term claims into equity investments in South Africa .
Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank was " investigating the implications of such conversions in light of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system .
" Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that " some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view of South Africa .
" Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay 1 . 42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the next three years .
The agreement extends a standstill arrangement , expiring June 30 , that has been in place since August , 1985 .
Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the monetary authorities .
" They ( creditors ) asked for the maximum amount and we offered the minimum ," said one banking source , reacting to reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger repayments .
Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa should have " no difficulty whatsoever " with the terms .
Economists said the debt agreement would have no significant impact on economic problems continuing to face South Africa including high rates of inflation and unemployment , labour unrest and political uncertainty .
Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton , speaking yesterday before the debt agreement , said the economy was " in bad shape " and there was " an awful lot of talk but little action " to cure serious problems .
MAYTAG & lt ; MYG > SEES CAPITAL SPENDING UP IN 1987 Maytag Co said it expects capital spending in 1987 to increase to about 60 mln dlrs from 49 mln dlrs in 1986 .

Earlier , the company reported 1986 net income of 111 . 2 mln dlrs , or 2 . 57 per share , versus net income of 124 . 9 mln dlrs , or 2 . 89 dlrs a share , in 1985 .

IRAN SAYS HAS BETTER WEAPONS THAN SILKWORM Iranian Prime Minister Mir - Hossein Mousavi said Iran had " more effective " missiles at its disposal than the shore - to - sea missiles which had provoked U . S . Concern , Tehran Radio reported .
A U . S . State Department spokesman said last week Iran had acquired Chinese - made Silkworm missiles which posed a greater threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously used .
Tehran Radio , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp , quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after its forces overran southern Iraq ' s Faw peninsula in February last year that it had shore - to - sea missiles .
" The fact that the Americans , after so much delay , are now thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because Reagan needs this sensation now ," said Mousavi , speaking after a cabinet meeting in Tehran .
" We also announce today that these missiles are not the limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf ," he added .
Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to do with the U . S .
But Iran would resort to any action to defend the Gulf , " even those actions which are not thought probable by Westerners .

U . K . RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY Britain ' s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February , after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January , the Treasury said .
The underlying trend , which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges , is net of borrowings and repayments .
This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise .
The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest .
Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22 . 26 billion dlrs , after rising 29 mln in January to 21 . 95 billion .
Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month , after 163 mln in January , while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln , a Treasury spokesman said .
Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs .
In January , capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs , with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap .
The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England ' s market operations , but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today .
A Treasury spokesman , commenting on the reserves figures , said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels .
He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting .

COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs , improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture .
It said the earlier reported 57 . 1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69 . 13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U . S . Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium .

The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill , offered by Sen . John Melcher ( D - Mont .
), that would have required the U . S . Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries .
Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750 , 000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year , Senate staff said .
The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions ' activities .
Under the bill adopted by the committee , countries " friendly to the United States " would be eligible to host the trade missions .
Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico , the Philippines , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Senegal , Nigeria , Peru , Kenya , the Dominican Republic , Costa Rica , Malaysia , Venezuela , Tunisia and Morocco .
The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service , FAS , to have at least 850 full - time employees during fiscal years 1987 - 89 .
As of February 28 , FAS had 790 full - time employees , a FAS spokesman said .
BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED , SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS BAT Industries Plc & lt ; BTI . L > 1986 results , which were at the upper end of market expectations , showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued , share analysts said .
BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close .
They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1 . 39 billion pre - tax .
Stock market analysts said today ' s generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run - up to the results caused the fall in the share price .
" In the current market , people almost expect companies to beat expectations ," said one analyst , adding that pretax profits of 1 . 35 to 1 . 40 billion stg had been forecast .
BAT ' s 1986 figure of 1 . 39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1 . 17 billion .
Brokers noted that BAT ' s shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs .
BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago .
Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance .
He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services , in particular in the U . S . Sheehy also said the group had " no sizeable acquisitions " in sight in the near future .
Analysts said BAT ' s increasingly good performance in the U . K . Insurance area was encouraging .
Its declining debt - to - equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions , they said .

BALDRIGE SAYS JAPAN MUST OPEN ITS MARKETS Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan dominate the world electronics market .
Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United States would insist Japan open its markets to U . S . products as the U . S . market is open to Japanese products .
Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs , Baldrige said , " I ' m not prepared to say that , but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied .
" Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market .
" I can only conclude that the common objective of the Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market .
Given the importance of this market to U . S . industry in general and our defense base in particular , we cannot stand by idly ," he said .
He said it was these concerns about national security which led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan .

NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday , as exchange rates and short - term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks , money market dealers said .
Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow ' s tender for a securities repurchase pact , from which funds will be credited on Thursday , when an earlier pact expires , draining 16 billion marks from the system .
The tender was announced last Friday , because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday , and will close banks here this afternoon .
Because of the disruption to business from carnival , minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic , making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender .
Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week ' s pact to keep short - term rates down .
But because of uncertainty about banks ' current holdings , the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week , and top it up if necessary at next week ' s tender .
" I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little , to say 14 or 15 billion marks ," one dealer said .
" They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer ," he added .
An earlier pact expires next week , draining 8 . 5 billion marks from the system .
Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers .
Banks held 52 . 0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank , averaging 51 . 0 billion over the whole month , just clear of the 50 . 5 billion February reserve requirement .
Call money traded today at 3 . 85 / 95 pct , up from 3 . 80 / 90 yesterday .

ENERGY / U . S .
OIL OUTPUT Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U . S . oil production , but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken .
One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 . 5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods .
Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year .
The White House , reacting , said it did not favor amending the tax code , but would look at the proposal .
Herrington ' s proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department ' s report on energy and the national security .
The report said U . S . oil imports , rapidly rising , could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security .
He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria -- increase production , not cause economic dislocation , and be low cost to the taxpayer .
Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test , spurring production but fail the second and third .
He said it would raise production and return 120 , 000 oil workers to their jobs , but at the same time it lifted oil prices , the higher prices would cost 400 , 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs .
A tax on gasoline , he said , would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production .
In any case , U . S . officials say , President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax .
Options which meet Herrington ' s criteria include : - Loan - price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices .
It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs .
- A five pct tax credit for exploration and development .
It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 , 000 barrels a day , at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year .
- A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures .
It would increase production by 80 , 000 barrels a day , at a cost of 65 mln dlrs .
- Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration .
A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 , 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 , 000 dlrs .
Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas , which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 , 000 barrels daily .
He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf , which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil , and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , which may hold nine billion barrels .
Herrington said he understood the Reagan ' s reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals , but added he hoped his department ' s energy / security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry .
Another move Herrington said he will press anew , even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House , is to raise the fill - rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100 , 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 , 000 .
This , he said , would further bolster national security in case of an oil - supply disruption .
TODD SHIPYARDS & lt ; TOD > OMITS COMMMON DIVIDEND Todd Shipyards Corp said it omitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock and lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75 cts from 77 cts a share .
Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one to shareholders of record April 15 .
The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and increased reserves for previously announced discontinued shipyard operations .
In addition , the company said its lenders agreed to temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving credit and term - loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln .
The reduction will hold through May 15 , it said .
Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented it from violating covenants of its credit agreement .
The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15 .
Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the U . S . Navy ' s unwillingness to release certain retentions under completed ship construction contracts and a general decrease in U . S . military spending .

CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE Canada ' s federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one - third of a company ' s oil and gas exploration and development costs , Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced .
The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment , Masse told a news conference .
The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1 , 1987 .
Masse told reporters that the government ' s oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies .
The aid package , called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program , will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year .
Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20 , 000 people working for a year .
He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986 .
Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non - tax paying companies , mainly small Canadian firms , will receive the full value of the incentive .
Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits , he said .
The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system .
Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada ' s tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring .
An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow - through shares , allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies , he said .
Allowing flow - through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development , Masse said .
He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy .
MOBIL PLANS TO OPEN OFFICE IN PEKING Mobil Oil Corp of U . S . Plans to open an office in Peking to develop oil exploration opportunities in China , the China Daily said .
It quoted Mobil president Richard Tucker , currently in Peking , as saying he is optimistic about investment prospects in China and that Peking will continue to encourage foreign private businesses to invest here .
It said Mobil bought 73 mln dlrs of crude oil and oil products from China in 1986 and sold it lubricant and fertiliser , but gave no more details .
COCOA TALKS SLOW AT CRUCIAL STAGE - DELEGATES International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations , delegates said , but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday .
Cocoa producers , European Community ( EC ) consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday .
The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time , they said .
Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non - member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock , and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager .
Producers would prefer that non - member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because , if it is , countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it , the delegates said .

MIDDLE SOUTH & lt ; MSU > TO FORM NEW DIVIDEND POLICY Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a conversative approach to formulating a new common stock dividend policy , chairman Edwin Lupberger said .
He told securities analysts that when the company ' s common dividend is resumed , " the initial rate will appear conservative to you by industry standards and in relation MSU ' s net income and cash flow .
" " Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a dividend to our common stockholders , he said .
" The company last paid a common dividend of 44 . 5 cts a share in July 1985 .
Lupberger told the analysts that the company ' s primary objective is " to create financial strength , enough strength so that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past couple of years never happens again .
" The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant .
He said Middle South ' s net income is expected to post " modest growth " over the next three years .
In 1986 , the company earned 451 . 3 mln dlrs or 2 . 21 dlrs a share on revenues of 3 . 49 billion dlrs .
Lupberger said , " A good portion of the improvement projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid on operating and maintenance expenses .

U . S . SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF - DESTRUCT , CONGRESSMAN A leading U . S . farm - state Congressman , Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners , perhaps including corn sweeteners , if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year .
" We ' re moving toward a direction where we could self - destruct ( the U . S . sugar program )," Rep . Huckaby , chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues , told Reuters in an interview .
Huckaby , who told U . S . sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases , said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday .
He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject .
Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota , now at one mln short tons .
" I think if we ' re talking about dropping ( the quota ) another half mln tons , lets say , you ' re getting to the point where the program might not work ," he said .
" Ideally , I ' d like to freeze things right where we are ," said Huckaby , leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress .
A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6 . 5 mln tons , the corn sweetener share of the U . S . market staying at just over 50 pct , and U . S sugar imports holding at about 1 . 2 mln tons , Huckaby said .
A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year , he said .
" I feel like if we didn ' t expand production , we could probably hold where we are indefinitely , or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes ( in the sugar program )," Huckaby said .
However , much depends on whether high - fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U . S . sweetener market from just over 50 pct , Huckaby said .
He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U . S .
But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share , then U . S . sugar imports might be eliminated and U . S . sugar output severely reduced .
Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A . E .
Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon .
" This program is advantageous to the corn users .
They have some natural , legitimate self - interest in seeing that the program is preserved ," Huckaby said .
Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled , either through production allocations , acreage or marketing controls .
Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production .
" I don ' t know if we will go this route , but if we do there ' s a question in my mind at this point in time ; can you do that legally ?
" he said .
Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners , Huckaby said " You build a fragile house if you do it that way .
" Huckaby said he understands why U . S . cane and beet farmers have expanded production , because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain .
But he said for sugar growers as a whole , expansion would not be good policy .
Huckaby said he has tried to stress , in his speeches to sugar industry groups , that if growers continue to expand , they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year .
Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program .
" The administration proposal is so drastic , that I don ' t think it will get up a head of steam ," Huckaby said .
He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved .
Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program , Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community ' s sugar policy .
He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market .

The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro .
For the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation ' s 40 , 000 seamen , who began a national strike on February 27 .
A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end .
Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak , with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil ' s crisis - laden economy .
" If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt ," said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo .
Today Brazil ' s 50 , 000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike , with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim .
David Fleischer , head of the political science department in Brasilia university , told Reuters the National Association of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds .
He said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government , the Liberal Front Party , PFL , of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections .
The PFL holds the Education Ministry .
Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the current labour unrest , caused by the return of high inflation , officially pegged at 33 pct for January - February .
Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil industry workers and social security workers .

The company also said it expects to realize a profit of about 300 , 000 dlrs on its 25 pct interest in the Briarcliff Manor condominium project in New York , with about 140 , 000 dlrs of the profit being reflected in the year ending September 30 .

TWA & lt ; TWA > SELLS POSITION IN USAIR & lt ; U > Trans World Airlines Inc sold four mln shares it held in USAir Group Inc , Wall Street sources said .
The sources said the buyers are believed to be a group of institutions .
Bear Stearns handled the trade .
It crossed the four mln shares at 45 , off 1 / 8 .
Bear Stearns would not comment on buyers or sellers .
USAir and TWA had no immediate comment .
USAir later said it did not buy the stock .
A company spokesman would not comment further .
TWA earlier this month reported holding slightly more than four mln shares , or about 15 pct of USAir .
It had also proposed a takeover of USAir , which at the time was negotiating its proposed merger with Piedmont Aviation Inc . On March 16 , TWA withdrew its bid , saying it did not intend to seek control of USAir Group or to acquire more of its stock at the time .
TWA also said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its chairman , Carl Icahn is the target of an SEC probe of alleged violations of securities laws .
In its filings with the SEC , TWA said it paid 178 . 2 mln dlrs for its USAir stock .
" With this out of the way , if it indeed was bought by institutions , it paves the way for better value for USAir stock later ," said Janney Montgomery analyst Louis Marckesano of TWA ' s sale of its stock .
" Technically , as long as that block was overhanging the market you didn ' t know what was going to happen ," he said .
USAir stock was trading at 44 - 3 / 8 , off 3 / 4 on volume of 4 . 4 mln shares .
TWA stock rose one to 28 - 1 / 4 .
COMBUSTION ENGINEERING & lt ; CSP > SEES 1ST QTR NET OFF Combustion Engineering Inc said it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the year - ago 13 . 6 mln dlrs , mainly due to financing costs resulting from the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp .
The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln common shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 2017 , with proceeds to be used to refinance the short - term bank debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition , to finance other costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes .
Combustion said 3 , 500 , 000 shares will be sold in the U . S . and the remainder overseas .
Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay , a maker of computer - based measurement and control systems used in pulp and paper mills .
The company said it expects to release first quarter results in the third week in April .
Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core businesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through staff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of facilities .
Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year losses in the Engineering and Construction segment .
But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be approximately offset by a number of factors , including a somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation segment than in 1986 , financing costs of the AccuRay acquisition , costs associated with integrating AccuRay technology and operations and delays in waste to energy projects .
NEWMONT GOLD SEES ITS SALES RISING 22 PCT Newmont Gold Corp expects gold sales in 1987 to rise about 22 pct to 577 , 000 ounces from 1986 ' s 474 , 000 ounces , the company said in its annual report .

MIDDLE SOUTH & lt ; MSU > TO CONSIDER DIVIDEND Middle South Utilities Inc will not consider payment of a common stock dividend until there is another ruling on a Mississippi Supreme Court order rolling back rates at the company ' s Mississippi Power and Light Co subsidiary , chairman Edwin Lupberger said .
He told security analysts Middle South was close to recommending resumption of the common stock dividend when the Mississippi court ordered the rate rollback .
Following the order , he noted , the unit cancelled a planned sale of preferred stock .
Middle South has petitioned the court for a rehearing or a stay of the order while it is being appealed .
BELGIUM PLANS TO OUTLAW INSIDER TRADING A Belgian finance ministry spokesman said new rules planned on insider trading would enable offenders to be fined and imprisoned for up to a year , and be compelled to forfeit gains .
The new rules require parliamentary approval , and government sources said it was unclear when they would come into force .
Insider trading is currently not an offence in this country .
The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said includes provisions to make more difficult the build - up of major new stakes in Belgian companies .
The bill would make obligatory the declaration of major stakes in companies quoted on the bourse with own resources of more than 200 mln francs .
The Minister for Economic Affairs would need to be informed in advance of deals under which foreign interests planned to buy a new stake of more than ten pct of the voting shares in a large Belgian company , or to increase an existing stake to more than 20 pct .

OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING , SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15 . 8 mln barrels a day , and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs , Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said .
He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U . S . And Europe which reduced demand for oil .
Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock , he said .
He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling .
Asked what Opec ' s output level was now , he replied : " Below 15 . 8 ( mln barrels per day ).
" He did not elaborate .
He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market , but if all Opec members stick by the cartel ' s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties .
He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987 .
He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting .
He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price .
" We hope the weak price will be overcome , and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters .
" Refiners , he said , appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall .
But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together .
ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986 / 87 soybean crop , which will begin to be harvested in mid - April , trade sources said .
They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7 . 5 and 7 . 8 mln tonnes , down from last week ' s estimate of 7 . 7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8 . 0 to 8 . 4 mln tonnes forecast in mid - February .
The new forecast is still higher than last season ' s record total production .
Private sources put 1985 / 86 production at a record 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes -- 4 . 2 to 6 . 4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop .
The official figure for 1985 / 86 is 7 . 1 mln tonnes , 5 . 6 to 9 . 9 pct below this season ' s new estimates .
Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires .
The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall .
Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield .
The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares , 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct higher than the 1985 / 86 record of 3 . 34 mln hectares .
The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense , heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm .
Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates .
The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts .
In other areas , especially western Buenos Aires , where rainfall was more than 200 mm , parts of the sunflower , maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged .
The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios .
The area sown with maize this season was between 3 . 58 and 3 . 78 mln hectares , two to seven pct less than the 3 . 85 mln hectares in 1985 / 86 .
The yield of 1986 / 87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes .
This estimate is 19 . 8 to 20 . 2 pct lower than the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985 / 86 production and 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the official 12 . 8 mln tonnes .
The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods .
A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields .
The area sown this season was 2 . 0 to 2 . 2 mln hectares , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct on last year ' s record 3 . 14 mln hectares .
Sunflowerseed 1986 / 87 production is still forecast at 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes , 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct below the 1985 / 86 record of 4 . 1 mln tonnes .
The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains , advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown .
The area sown was 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares , 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct less than the 1 . 45 mln hectares the previous season .
Yield estimates remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes , 16 . 7 to 22 pct down on 1985 / 86 production of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes .

CYCLOPS & lt ; CYL > SAYS DIXONS APPOINTEES RESIGN Cyclops Corp said the three members of its board appointed last week by & lt ; Dixons Group PLC > had resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives to replace them .
Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier today by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclops outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that expired yesterday .
Dixons initially ended its 90 . 25 dlr a share tender offer on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares .
However , the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U . K .- based company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops stock be tendered by the close of the offer .
Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops shares had been withdrawn , leaving it with only 852 , 000 shares , or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4 . 26 mln Cyclops shares outstanding .
Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares , which , when combined with the shares it already holds , gives it a 21 . 7 pct stake in Cyclops .
Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three newly named directors and five outside directors , all of whom were on the board prior to Dixons tender offer .
The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixons appointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between the two companies .

U . S . SENATE TRADE LEADER CONCERNED ABOUT CANADA The chairman of the U . S . Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week .
The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty , social programs , agricultural marketing systems , the auto industry and Canada ' s cultural identity .
Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries , which are each other ' s largest trading partners .
" We need a truly free trade agreement , which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive , a large agreement ," the Texas Democrat said in a statement .
" I do not question Canada ' s right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity .
However , if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations , I am deeply concerned ," he added .
Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods .
He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction , it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval .
" I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister ( Brian ) Mulroney next month , he will be presented with this kind of argument , and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful ," Bentsen said .
Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5 - 6 in Ottawa .
Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by non - Canadians , which the senator called a protectionist measure .

WILLING TO COOPERATE TO STABILIZE EXCHANGE RATES
BAKER SAYS U . S .
WANTS TO STABILIZE EXCHANGE RATES Treasury Secretary James Baker said the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month .
" Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions ," Baker told a Senate committee .
Baker continued , " We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels .
" He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters .
Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar .
" I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements ," Baker said .
Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world ' s economy .
He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth .
Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final .
Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation .

EDELMAN GROUP IN PLAN TO BUY MORSE SHOE & lt ; MRS > A group led by New York investor Asher Edelman said Morse Shoe Inc agreed to provide it confidential company information and that his group would make an offer to buy Morse only in a friendly , negotiated deal .

Edelman and his group said his terms held until the earlier of 90 days from March 3 or the date on which Morse announces a definite agreement for its sale .
At the same time , the Edelman group said it cut its stake in Morse to 8 . 4 pct from 9 . 7 pct .
JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER , YEAR & lt ; John Labatt Ltd > anticipates a good fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending April 30 , president Peter Widdrington told financial analysts .
He would not make any specific forecast , but said he was optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company ' s brewing and food products operations .
Labatt ' s earnings rose to 92 . 8 mln dlrs in the nine months ended January 31 from year - earlier 78 mln dlrs .
Revenue for the nine months rose to 3 . 20 billion dlrs from 2 . 70 billion dlrs .
Widdrington said Labatt ' s three - year business plan , now being updated , targets total sales of about six billion dlrs , including 2 . 50 billion dlrs in the U . S . Labatt , Canada ' s leading brewer , has expanded in the U . S . food products industry by acquisitions .
Widdrington said Labatt ' s strategy for U . S . expansion stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian food and beverage industry .
The U . S . share of revenues for this year will be about 35 pct , rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988 , he said .
HUSKY & lt ; HYO > SETS MEETING TO APPROVE MERGER Husky Oil Ltd said the board called a special meeting for April 22 for shareholders to vote on its previously announced agreement for Hong Kong - based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd and Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd to acquire a 43 pct interest in the company .

WASHINGTON GAS LIGHT CO & lt ; WGL > HIKES PAYOUT Qtly div 45 cts vs 44 cts prior Pay May one Record April 10
FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS & lt ; CG > NET Columbia Gas System Inc said a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1 . 25 dlrs a share .
The company said " this could bring earnings for 1987 below Columbia ' s stated goal of earning no less than its 3 . 18 dlrs per share dividend .
" It earned 2 . 12 dlrs a share in 1986 .
It said management expects to recommend to the board that the dividend rate be maintained in 1987 .
Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be offset by a one - time accounting change rleated to future tax liabilities under the new federal tax laws .
The company recorded these liabilities based on older , higher tax rates , but an action being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of about 1 . 20 dlrs a share in 1987 , it explained .
" Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987 earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned ," Columbia Gas said .
Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas Transmission Corp , the company ' s principal pipeline subsidiary .
It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase contracts .
These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary failed to sufficiently support cost recovery .
The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from making a new filing to provide sufficient support .
JAPAN ' S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3 . 5 PCT Japan ' s unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3 . 5 pct within the next year from January ' s three pct record , senior economists , including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan , said .
December ' s 2 . 9 pct was the previous worst level since the government ' s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953 .
" There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment ," said Takashi Kiuchi , senior economist for the Long - Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd .
The government , which published the January unemployment figures today , did not make any predictions .
" At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year , but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving ," a Labour Ministry official said .
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300 , 000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April .
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms .
The yen ' s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries .
Other export - dependent industries , such as cars and textiles , have laid off part - time employees and ceased hiring , economists said .
Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down , said Koichi Tsukihara , Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd ' s economics department .
However , other economists disagreed , saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years .
U . S . OFFERS MORE CREDITS FOR VEG OIL TO N . YEMEN The U . S . Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) has authorized an additional 10 . 0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to cover sales of U . S . vegetable oils to North Yemen , the U . S . Agriculture Department said .
The department also said at the request of the North Yemen Government five mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of wheat have been switched to cover sales of mixed poultry feed .
The actions increase the value of credit guarantees for vegetable oil for the current fiscal year to 38 mln dlrs , reduce the guarantee coverage for sales of wheat to eight mln dlrs and increase the coverage for sales of mixed poultry feed to 10 mln dlrs .
All exports must be completed by September 30 , 1987 .

CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS Canada may begin monitoring steel flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is being illegally " trans - shipped " to the U . S ., senior government trade officials said .
The officials , asking not to be identified , said the government will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being diverted to the U . S . and ultimately exasperating concerns about the level of Canadian exports south of the border .
But the senior officials , asking not to be indentified , said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan Administration , Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal limits on Canadian shipments to the U . S . " In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time ," said one official who claimed Canadian companies were " fair traders " in the big American market .
If approved by the Canadian cabinet , the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or four months .
" I guess if we find trans - shipment is a problem , we would have to do something about it ," said a trade official .
Canadian steel shipments to the U . S . have risen to 5 . 7 pct of the U . S . market in recent months , almost double the level just two years ago .
The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U . S . over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel producers .
Some U . S . lawmakers have proposed Canada ' s share of the American market be limited to 2 . 4 per cent .
The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country .
Currently , import licences are required only for carbon or raw steel , which makes up less than half the steel market .
Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in 1986 , while importing 944 - mln dlrs worth of the product in the same year .

COCOA COUNCIL CHAIRMAN SEEKS BUFFER COMPROMISE International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , Council chairman , Denis Bra Kanon , said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement .
Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non - member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa , consumer delegates told reporters .
Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems .
Producers and consumers indicated support " in principle " for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group , consumer delegates said .
Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends , but certain technical points need further clarification , the delegates said .
Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities , consumer delegates said .
Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas , such as Ghana origin , which are normally required by manufacturers , they said .
Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non - member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa , which would depress prices , they added .
SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS , SALES & lt ; SNC Group Inc > expects 1987 earnings to rise to 1 . 20 - 1 . 40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last year , with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last year ' s 350 mln dlrs , president Alex Taylor said before the annual meeting .
SNC , Canada ' s second biggest engineering and construction group , became the country ' s largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals Ltd from the Canadian government .
The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987 , Taylor said .
Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC ' s total 1987 revenues , helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities , Taylor said .
Last year , SNC earned 8 . 7 mln dlrs , including a small extraordinary gain .
In 1987 , a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues , and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs , he said , adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings .

U . S . SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law .
The industry trade association called on U . S . securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees .
The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers .
But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate .
The SIA , in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors , backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U . S . stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages .
The report said securities firms " should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need - to - know basis .
" It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market - sensitive information .
It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market .
It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing .
In the mergers and acquisitions area , the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval .
It said a group or individual buying up a company ' s stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company ' s shares .
Under current law , disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit .
The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company ' s voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders .
Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases .
The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics .
The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days .
The current requirement is expressed in business days .
It said so - called " lockup " devices , in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18 . 5 pct of the target company ' s total common stock .
Association president Edward O ' Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace .
TEXACO & lt ; TX > RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT Texaco Inc ' s oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company ' s previous reserve estimates , its annual report said .
The statement of the report ' s auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by Pennzoil Co & lt ; PZL > against Texaco on charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil ' s contract to acquire Getty Oil Co .
The auditor ' s point out , as Texaco has in the past , the company ' s loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it " to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 " of the federal bankruptcy code .
Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil ' s judgement by two billion dlrs , to 9 . 1 billion dlrs , Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30 .
Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2 . 54 billion barrels at the end of 1986 , down from 2 . 69 billion a year earlier .
However , inclusion of Texaco ' s equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2 . 91 billion barrels from 3 . 00 billion at the end of 1985 .
Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln , respectively .
Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States -- where the total dropped to 1 . 46 billion barrels from 1 . 55 billion .
The company said U . S . liquids production averaged 660 , 000 barrels per day last year , down from 714 , 000 in 1985 , with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24 , 000 barrels per day -- representing high - cost production shut - in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986 .
Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8 . 16 trillion cubic feet at year end , down from 8 . 87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985 .
INT ' L MINERALS PROJECT TO BOOST HOG LEAN WEIGHT International Minerals and Chemical Corp said its board approved a 50 mln dlrs budget over the next several years to build production facilities for a newly developed product to be used to improve the lean weight of hogs .
The new product , porcine somatotropin ( PST ) is described as a natural bio - synthetic protein that improves the lean weight and rate of weight gain , as well as reduces the cost of feed for market hogs , the company said .
Specific details of the PST production project , including sites for proposed facilities and engineering plans , were not disclosed .
International Minerals said it set a completion target for the spring of 1989 , by which time necessary Food and Drug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained .

SOUTHWESTERN BELL & lt ; SBC > SEES EARNINGS DILUTION Southwestern Bell Corp said that its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging systems , including those of & lt ; Metromedia Inc >, will result in some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio .
In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report , the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions , which total some 1 . 38 billion dlrs .
However , the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range .
In its 1986 yearend financial statement , Southwestern Bell listed a debt - to - equity ratio of 43 . 4 pct , down slightly from 43 . 7 pct in 1985 .
In 1986 , the company earned 1 . 02 billion dlrs , or 10 . 26 dlrs a share , compared with 996 . 2 mln dlrs , or 10 dlrs a share in 1985 .
Revenues dipped to 7 . 90 billion dlrs from 7 . 93 billion dlrs .
Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow , due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits .
By mid - year , however , the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow .
In addition , the company said it is projecting a 1 . 7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes .
Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1 . 97 billion dlrs spent in 1986 , a year in which expenditures were held below budget .
BRAZIL WANTS TO INCREASE STEEL EXPORTS TO U . S . Brazil wants to increase its steel exports to the United States , now limited because of tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan administration , a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute ( IBS ) said .
Brazilian and U . S . Trade officials held the first of a three - day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue .
In 1984 , after three months of painstaking negotiations , the U . S . Government reached accords with seven steel - exporting nations - Australia , Brazil , Japan , Mexico , Spain , South Africa and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United States by about 30 pct in 1985 .
The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil ' s steel exports to the U . S . Could not exceed 632 , 000 tonnes , increasing to 640 , 000 tonnes in 1988 and 670 , 000 tonnes in 1989 , the last of the five - year deadline set by the agreements .
Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil ' s export share of non - flat products to the U . S . Market .
The spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply problems in the United States .

HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd & lt ; SHLH . HK >' s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd & lt ; EVGH . HK > group , stock brokers said .
They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo ' s & lt ; China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd > unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm ' s deputy chairman David Liang for 1 . 06 billion dlrs .
The stock rose 12 H . K .
Dlrs to 62 dlrs today .
Thomas Lau , Evergo ' s executive director , declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels .
But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment .
He said Evergo " was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels .
" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel , one of Asia ' s best known hotels , and another site on Hong Kong island .
Both are owned by Hk Hotels .
& lt ; Lai Sun Garment Co ltd > yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs .
Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake .
" It is purely coincidence ," he said .
But analysts were not so certain , saying that the Evergo group , which has a reputation as a corporate raider , may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover .
Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family , which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels .
Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels .
Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board .
A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far .
Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles .
" Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family ," said an analyst who asked not to be named .
Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share .
The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share , though that is well below the current trading price .
Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun , Evergo , China Entertainment and the group ' s associate & lt ; Chinese Estates Ltd >.
Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20 . 15 dlrs yesterday , China Entertainment five to 8 . 60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents .
Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70 . 50 dlrs .
BALDRIGE SEES U . S . TRADE DEFICIT STARTING TO DECLINE IN FEB OR MARCH DATA
BALDRIGE SEES U . S . TRADE DEFICIT STARTING TO DECLINE IN FEB OR MARCH DATA
BALDRIGE SEES U . S . TRADE GAP DROPPING SOON Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the U . S . trade deficit should start to decline soon , possibly in the figures for February or March .
" We could see the trade deficit start down in February or March ," Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee .
He predicted the trade deficit , which was 170 billion dlrs in 1986 , would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in 1988 .
Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the February trade figures , but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986 and will continue to drop in this quarter .
The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar , Baldrige said .
Ealier , Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee that the trade deficit had levelled off , but Baldrige said he was more optimistic , adding , " I think we turned the corner in February .

LOWER U . S .
SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED U . S . soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U . S . soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel next year .
" I don ' t know who in Congress would propose that happening .
Politically it would be totally unacceptable ," an aide to a senior farm - state senator said .
USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4 . 77 dlrs .
" I ' m convinced that Congress will not go along with this ," American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said .
Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4 . 56 dlrs , USDA could then consider ways to make U . S . soybeans more competitive .
His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the the administration ' s position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers ' income .
Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive .
USDA secretary Richard Lyng , however , continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan , saying such a move would be too costly .
" There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one ( the Amstutz proposal ," said Bill O ' Conner , aide to Rep . Edward Madigan ( R - Ill ), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee .
" Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan ," O ' Conner said .

U . S . CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U . S . government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U . S .- Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement .
In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement .
The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required .
" America ' s interests require that agreements be honored and that U . S . industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments ," the trade group said .
The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday .
The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign - based manufacturers .

KANSAS CITY & lt ; KSU > READY TO BUY SOUTHERN PACIFIC Kansas City Southern Industries Inc said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp & lt ; SFX > if the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe ' s attempt to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison , Tokepa and Santa Fe Railway .
In a filing with the ICC late today , the company outlined four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific .
Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date , and that the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged from today onward .
" We are willing , even eager , to make a fair market value offer in cash for the Southern Pacific ," said Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H . Rowland .
" This offer disproves the constant derogation of the Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management , best exemplified by SFSP Chief Executive John Schmidt ' s comment in ICC hearings that the Southern Pacific was ' bankrupt ,'" said Rowland .
He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve the benefits of an end - to - end merger while preseving the independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime competitor , Santa Fe .
Kansas said that Southern ' s management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1 . 2 billion dlrs .
It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc , hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their merger , appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than Southern ' s own internal valuations .
Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for Southern after its books , records and properties are examined .
" Once that examination has been completed ( and even in the absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate ) KCSI will make an offer in writing ...." said the company .
Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission ' s reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific , two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes .
ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive .
Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the Union Pacific , the Denver and Rio Grande Western and other railroads , adds to the value of the merger .
GENCORP & lt ; GY > BID COULD BE RAISED , GROUP SAYS An investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting .
" We might be able to see some additional value if we could meet " and get more financial data , said Joel Reed , speaking for the investor group .
Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A . William Reynolds " was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time .
" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with Reynolds , Reed said .
Wagner and Brown , along with AFG Industries Inc & lt ; AFG >, recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp .
The offer is worth 2 . 23 billion dlrs .
Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer , which expires April 15 , is a fair offer .
GenCorp gained 3 - 1 / 2 to 114 today on the NYSE .
Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his group wins control .
He said aerospace , soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates .
He said the tire business , which the group wants to keep , may be more viable if merged with another tire company .
" One option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition ," Reed said .
He said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry .
Gary Miller , chief financial officer of AFG , said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity .
Automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success , he said .
In the case of GenCorp ' s RKO General broadcasting stations , Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp ' s shoes and proceed with plans to sell the stations .
The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they intend to consummate sale of WOR - TV in New York to MCA Inc & lt ; MCA >.
GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs .
The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ - TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co & lt ; DIS >.
RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs and Fidelilty Television , which challenged the license , would get about 103 mln dlrs .
The partners also said the Federal Communications Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit .
Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer .
He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations .
Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in Akron , Ohio , where GenCorp is headquartered , Reed said , " the plan of the partners offers long term growth for Ohio .
" He noted that the aerospace business , slated for divestiture under the partners ' plan , is located in California .
" Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments ," he said .
UNOCAL & lt ; UCL > PLANS INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING Unocal Corp said it intends to increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in 1987 , eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986 .
The company said in its annual report that it would increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986 ' s 595 mln dlrs , assuming oil prices hold around current levels .
The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987 remains well below the 1 . 1 billion dlrs spent in 1985 , Unocal said .
The company ' s proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil rose slightly in 1986 , Unocal said .
Net crude oil and condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31 , 1986 , compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985 , Unocal said .
The company said its net crude oil and condensate production averaged 248 , 200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to 251 , 300 bpd in 1985 .
Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6 . 07 billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985 ' s 6 . 19 billion .
Net natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986 , down 10 pct from 1985 ' s 1 , 084 mln , the company said .
Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was 12 . 67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23 . 81 dlrs in 1985 , and its average sales price for natural gas was 2 . 03 dlrs per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2 . 24 dlrs in 1985 .
Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas declined nearly 30 pct to 3 . 41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent in 1986 from 4 . 81 dlrs in 1985 , Unocal said .
In the annual report , the company called for imposition of an oil import fee by the U . S . government to set a floor price of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil .
" Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel will not materialy slow the drop in U . S . production or the rise in imports ," Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report .
" Without decisive action in Washington , this nation will once again become a hostage to OPEC ' s plans and policies ," Hartley said .
FED APPROVES CHEMICAL NEW YORK & lt ; CHL > MERGER Chemical New York Corp and Texas Bancshares Inc & lt ; TCB > said the Federal Reserve Board approved their proposed 1 . 19 billion dlr merger .
The companies also said the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective as of March 24 the registration statement covering the securities Chemical will issue to Texas Bancshares shareholders as part of the merger .
The companies said they expect to complete the merger , which will create a bank with 80 billion dlrs of assets , by the end of the second quarter .
The merger still requires shareholder approval .
VARITY & lt ; VAT > SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR Varity Corp , earlier reporting a full year loss against a prior year profit , said improvement is expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the inventory pipeline , cutbacks in operating costs are realized and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully integrated .
However , operating results are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter ending April 30 , it said .
Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23 . 3 mln U . S . dlrs , compared to a year - earlier profit of 3 . 9 mln dlrs .
Varity said continued deterioration in major markets , a weakening U . S . dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss .
Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year , with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year ' s depressed levels , the company said .
However , Varity increased its share of the global tractor market by more than one pct to 18 . 2 pct , it said .
The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign exchange adjustments on margins was substantial , Varity said .
CAMPBELL RESOURCES & lt ; CCH > UPS MESTON LAKE STAKE Campbell Resources Inc said it raised its voting stake in & lt ; Meston Lake Resources Inc > to about 64 pct from 52 pct through acquisition of another 870 , 000 Meston Lake shares in its previously reported takeover bid .
Campbell , in its bid that expired March 23 , offered 80 cts cash and 1 . 25 " legended " Campbell shares for each Meston share .
The legended shares are not tradeable for one year .
It said the 3 . 4 mln Meston shares not tendered in the offer were held by about 550 stockholders , including Quebec ' s La Societe de developpement de la Baie James , with 1 . 3 mln shares .

PENNZOIL ( PZL ) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO ( TX ) LAWSUIT Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any " meaningful settlement offer " from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10 . 2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco .
In its newly - released annual report to shareholders , Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment , which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12 , to be upheld if appealed again .
" To date , Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco , though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter ," Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report .
Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987 , a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year .
Proved U . S . and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year , from 1 . 01 trillion cubic feet in 1985 , because of a virtual halt in its exploration program , Pennzoil said .
Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985 .
The Houston - based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year , a 17 pct drop from 1985 .
The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2 . 16 dlrs per mcf , Pennzoil said .
U . S . crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33 , 290 barrels per day from 34 , 102 barrels per day in 1985 .
The company ' s total revenues in 1986 declined to 482 . 3 mln dlrs , from 762 . 5 mln dlrs the previous year .
Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct , to 38 . 0 mln dlrs .
Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast , to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell - Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico ' s Mobile Bay area .
" Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California ," the company said .
" Pennzoil ' s share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day , increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day , net , by 1989 .
" In its sulphur business , Pennzoil said production totaled 2 . 1 mln long tons last year , a decline of 18 pct from 1985 .
The average sales price also declined , to 138 . 25 dlrs per long ton from 141 . 05 dlrs in 1985 .
" The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright ," the company said .
" We expect sulphur ' s pricing structure to strengthen during the current year , probably in the third and fourth quarters .

EXCHANGE RATE BILL CLEARS U . S . HOUSE PANEL The House Banking Committee adopted legislation to direct the U . S . Treasury to begin negotiations aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by countries such as Taiwan and South Korea , whose currencies are pegged to the value of the U . S . dollar .
The measure was adopted as part of a wide - ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves on to the Senate .
The bill ' s many provisions also set as a priority for the U . S . the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations .
In addition , the Banking Committee bill would authorize U . S . banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt problems of developing countries , such as lowering interest rates on existing debt , renegotiating loans or debt forgiveness .
The bill would give a blanket waiver of any federal banking regulations that bar such actions .
The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to discuss with debt - ridden developing countries the possibility of the U . S . setting up a public debt management agency that would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the restructuring of the debt .
The Banking bill authorizes U . S . participation in a multilateral investment guarantee agency ( MIGA ) as requested by the administration .
Congress would approve an initial U . S . subscription of 22 mln dlrs .
And , it sets up a council on industrial competitiveness composed of industry and administration members to explore ways to make the U . S . more competitive in world markets .
U . S . CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U . S . government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U . S .- Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement .
In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and continue until the U . S . is satisfied there is full compliance with the agreement .
The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required .
" America ' s interests require that agreements be honored and that U . S . industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments ," the trade group said .
The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday .
The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign - based manufacturers .

They said they might revive merger plans at a later date or seek other ways for Clabir to increase its holdings in AmBrit .
COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress , eager to find budget savings , launches a review of the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s generic commodity certificate program tomorrow , amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office , GAO , are at odds over how much the program has cost U . S . taxpayers .
The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment - in - kind , or PIK , certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays , administration officials who asked not to be identified said .
USDA officials , however , took issue with the report , saying it did not take into account storage , handling and transport savings that accrue to the government .
The GAO then decided to re - examine the costs , sources said .
The issue is an important one , because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending .
Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow .
Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays , and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp , CCC , almost equal costs , department sources said .
USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store , handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage .
It was unclear whether the GAO , Congress ' investigative arm , would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs , Reagan administration sources said .
The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment - in - kind , PIK , certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold .
The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates .
The CCC issues dollar - denominated PIK certificates , or certs , as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters .
Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash .
Between April and December 1986 , CCC issued 3 . 8 billion dlrs worth of certificates , according to USDA .
Up to another 6 . 7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987 , according to USDA .
Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate .
Eliminating this practice , called " PIK and roll ," would save the government 1 . 4 billion dlrs between 1988 - 92 , according to the Congressional Budget Office , CBO .
That estimate , according to a CBO official , was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments .
The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK - and - roll transactions among other savings alternatives .
The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs , or between five and 20 pct , more than cash outlays , one administration official said .
However , the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism , department officials said .
The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year .
USDA ' s Economic Research Service , for example , has found that between June and August last year , the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel .
Between September and November , however , certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices , according to the ERS study , obtained by Reuters .

LATIN OIL PRODUCERS TO MEET IN CARACAS Five regional oil producing nations will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two - day meeting expected to center on ways to combat proposals for a U . S . tax on imported petroleum , the Venezuela ' s ministry of energy and mines said .
Oil ministers from Mexico , Trinidad and Tobago , Ecuador and Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters , formed in 1983 , it said .
Colombia will also attend for the first time , as an observer nation , the ministry said .
Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil .
Two of the group ' s members , Venezuela and Mexico , are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States , respectively , following Canada .
Venezuela , concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports , undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures .
In February , Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax .

The measure was adopted as part of a wide - ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves onto the Senate .
The bill ' s many provisions also set as a priority for the U . S . the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations .

TREASURY ' S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT TO FOSTER STABLE CURRENCIES
TREASURY ' S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT TO FOSTER STABLE CURRENCIES
BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS CURRENCY AGREEMENT Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels .
" I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals ," Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview .
" We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it ," he said .
Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to " co - operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels .
" He refused to comment directly on the current yen / dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended " to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say .
" Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U . S . currency , a statement that triggered this week ' s renewed decline of the dollar .
" I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co - ordination is alive and well ," Baker said .
The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances .
He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also " been very outspoken " in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can .
Baker noted that the J - curve , the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country ' s trade balance , takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar ' s value .
He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate , and pointed out the administration ' s package to improve U . S . Competitiveness was now before Congress .
NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES Employers and the port union , FNV , are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six - week - old dispute in Rotterdam ' s general cargo sector , but neither side is optimistic , spokesmen for both sides told Reuters .
Little progress was made in last night ' s three hours of talks , with both sides largely reiterating their positions .
" There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV , and I can ' t say that we expect to reach any agreement .
But at least we are still talking ," a union spokesman said .
Employers organization chairman , Jacques Schoufour , accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months .
" The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all .
" " If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector , then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month ," Schoufour said .
The series of strikes , which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks , began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector ' s 4 , 000 workforce starting with 350 this year .
Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector ' s 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy .
Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases , but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest .
BAKER SEES 15 TO 20 BILLION DLR DROP IN TRADE GAP Treasury Secretary James Baker said he expected the U . S . Trade deficit to fall by 15 billion to 20 billion dlrs in 1987 .
Commenting on the deficit during an interview on Cable News Network , Baker said " I think you ' re going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year .
" The deficit was 170 billion dlrs in 1986 .
Baker noted that the benefits of a weaker currency take 12 to 18 months to affect the trade balance , and said it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar ' s value .

FURTHER YEN RISE WOULD HURT JAPAN ECONOMY , SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy .
He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures , including market intervention , to stabilize exchange rates if necessary , in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations .
He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last .
Six major nations - Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable .
Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan .
He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased .
To prevent a resurgence of inflation , the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions , he said .
He said the latest discount rate cut to 2 . 5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand .
Commenting on the dollar ' s fall below 150 yen , Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency ' s weakness .
The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension , he said .
Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987 / 88 fiscal year ending April 1 , 1988 , provided exchange rates stabilize .
EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM The European Community ( EC ) considers talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round , Willy de Clercq , external relations commissioner of the EC , said .
He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early , seperate agreement on agricultural trade .
He said the EC wanted to stick to the four - year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last year .
That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re - negotiate the GATT .
Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services .
De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two - day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand .
Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms .
U . S . Trade representative , Clayton Yeutter , also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible .
But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations , and the EC did not want changes .
" We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached , and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking .
It is a global negotiation with no two tracks , no fast track , no slow track .
It has just one track , the track - and that ' s all ," de Clercq said .
" If you start selecting priorities , your priority is not my priority .
We say that agriculture is urgent , but it ' s not the only urgent thing ," he said .
He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months to prepare and eight days of negotiations .
VIETNAM ' S ARMY ORDERED TO GROW MORE FOOD Vietnam has ordered its army to grow more food to ease shortages and meet economic recovery goals set for 1990 .
The army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan , monitored here , said soldiers must work harder to care for rice , vegetables and other crops endangered by the present unusually hot weather .
The paper said the 1 . 6 - mln strong regular army contributed less than one pct to the nation ' s 18 . 2 mln tonne food output .
North Vietnam has set a 1990 food target of 23 to 24 mln tonnes .
LINDE TURNOVER UP IN FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1987 Engineering group Linde AG ' s & lt ; LING . F > world group turnover rose to 518 . 6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987 , 5 . 2 pct more than in the same 1986 period , management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said .
But world group incoming orders fell 2 . 2 pct to 587 . 3 mln marks , Meinhardt told the annual news conference .
Excluding exchange rate movements , world group turnover rose 8 . 9 pct and incoming orders increased 1 . 0 pct .
Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast .
Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105 . 79 mln marks from 80 . 71 mln .
Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6 . 7 pct to 394 . 1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5 . 2 pct to 456 . 6 mln .
Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks .
Linde ' s authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49 . 6 mln marks .
Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions .
He declined to give further details .
While world group turnover rose 7 . 2 pct to 3 . 88 billion marks in 1986 , incoming orders were barely changed at 3 . 91 billion marks .
Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies , incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year ' s level .
World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7 . 4 pct to 777 mln marks , but incoming orders dropped 5 . 7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge .
World sales for technical gases rose 5 . 1 pct to 1 . 05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5 . 2 pct to 1 . 05 billion marks .
Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector , with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria , Italy and Norway .
World group sales in the sector fell 2 . 5 pct to 493 mln marks , but incoming orders rose 2 . 5 pct to 513 mln marks .
The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12 . 4 pct to 1 . 52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8 . 0 pct to 1 . 57 billion marks .
Domestic group turnover rose 8 . 2 pct to 2 . 93 billion marks and incoming orders increased 1 . 9 pct to 2 . 92 billion marks .
The company was producing at full capacity in 1986 .

UNILEVER IMPROVES IN MOST SECTORS DURING 1986 The Unilever Plc and NV & lt ; UN . A > group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986 , the Anglo - Dutch group said in its results statement .
Very good progress was made last year , while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough - Pond ' s Inc & lt ; CBM . N > was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come .
Earlier , Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre - tax profit of 276 mln stg , level with the year earlier period , making 1 . 14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year .
Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates .
The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1 , 1987 .
Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2 , 575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal , though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts , dealers added .
TRADE SURPLUS CUT WOULD BENEFIT JAPAN - SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said it is in Japan ' s national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus .
He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem .
To this end , Japan and the U . S . Must make medium - and long - term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations .
World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries ' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue , he added .
GULF ESCORTS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION - WEINBERGER No action has been taken yet on the Reagan Adminstration ' s offer to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Gulf , but the issue is being discussed , U . S . Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said .
The offer was made to Kuwait in light of Iran ' s deployment of Chinese - built missiles to cover the entrance to the Gulf .
Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas Christian University that he did not think Iran and the United States were moving towards a potential conflict , adding that the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still " free water .

MIYAZAWA SAYS MAJOR NATIONS ACTING ON PARIS ACCORD Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in line with their agreement in Paris last month , government sources said .
Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations -- Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany -- are abiding by the Paris accord .
The six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels .
Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations ( G - 7 ) expected just before the IMF / World Bank Interim Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9 .
The sources quoted Miyazawa as saying Japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen .
Japan is taking the matter seriously , he added .
Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about 153 yen , the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris talks , Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would create an " unexpected situation .

BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper .
Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7 - 3 / 4 pct level set March 10 , but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely .
The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7 - 1 / 4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc .
Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing , but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short - term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions .
Call money rose yesterday to 7 - 7 / 8 eight pct from 7 - 3 / 4 7 / 8 pct .
Today it was first indicated at 8 - 1 / 8 1 / 4 before easing on news of the tender to 7 - 13 / 16 7 / 8 pct .
Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest monthly treasury tap stock tender , on March 5 , market sources said .
BP says it will tender for remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil at 70 dlrs a share cash
BP says it will tender for remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil at 70 dlrs a share cash
BP TO OFFER 7 . 4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP . L > said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co & lt ; SRD . N > it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash , for a total of 7 . 4 billion if the offer is fully accepted .
The offer would be made through its & lt ; BP North America Inc > unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1 .
The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered .
BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers .
It took into account reviews of both public and non - public information .
Standard closed in New York last night at 64 - 7 / 8 dlrs , down 1 - 3 / 4 dlrs .
BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night ' s close .
About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP ' s own resources .
The remainder would come from new borrowings , partly from banks under a four - year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U . S . Dlr commercial paper programme .
The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities .
BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group ' s investment in Standard was its largest single asset .
Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest .
BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources .
It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment .
Walters added that it also felt that , due to management changes in 1986 , Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment .
Standard ' s net assets at end - 1986 were 7 . 02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1 . 08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs .
Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise .
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled .
BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago .
It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U . K . Government ' s recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31 . 7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987 / 88 financial year , analysts said .
Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets .
The deal would probably push BP ' s gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently , he said .
However , with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year ' s rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good .
Standard was a high cost oil producer , the analysts noted .
Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money , and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus .
BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska ' s Prudhoe bay in 1969 .
BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U . S .
While Standard , which was strong on marketing and refining , was short on crude oil .
The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year .
The probability that much of the shake - up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer , Spedding said .
BP ' s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets .
The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors .
HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES Hoechst AG & lt ; HFAG . F > said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales .
The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark .
Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U . S . And Netherlands .
World group pretax profit rose to 3 . 21 billion marks in 1986 from 3 . 16 billion in 1985 , with sales falling to 38 . 01 billion from 42 . 72 billion .
Within group turnover , foreign sales fell to 27 . 18 billion marks in 1986 from 31 . 92 billion in 1985 , a drop of 14 . 9 pct .
The statement made no mention of net profit figures .
Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23 .
In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year .
If the dollar continues at present low levels , 1987 sales will again be below the previous year , although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986 , Hoechst said .
Sales of paints and dyes , fibres , sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell .
Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company , other units in West Germany , and to & lt ; American Hoechst Corp >.
Improved earnings in the U . S .
Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities .
Roussel Uclaf & lt ; RUCF . PA > and most domestic non - consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985 .
Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1 . 82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies , and a fall in extraordinary costs .
The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies , Hoechst said .
The bulk of the 2 . 53 billion marks investment in new projects , up from 294 mln marks in 1985 , went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of & lt ; Celanese Corp >.
Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form & lt ; Hoechst Celanese Corp >.

BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS Australia ' s largest company , The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S > ( BHP ), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28 , share analysts polled by Reuters said .
This would be well below the 813 . 0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985 / 86 .
In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988 . 2 mln dlrs .
The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs , against 238 . 6 mln a year earlier and 220 . 3 mln in the second quarter .
BHP ' s earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397 . 0 mln dlrs , sharply down from 589 . 3 mln a year earlier .
The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter , reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields , but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings .
They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems .
The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP ' s lowest - earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors , and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs .
One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division , they said .
They said they saw BHP ' s full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs .
They added that such a decline from 1985 / 86 would be no surprise , noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985 / 86 net profit .

INDIAN PLANT SIGNS FIRST ALUMINA EXPORT CONTRACT An unnamed Norwegian firm agreed to buy 100 , 000 tonnes of alumina a year from a refinery in eastern Orissa state due to start operations in the next 12 months , a Commerce Ministry official told Reuters .
He said the state - owned National Aluminium Co , which owns the plant , and the state - owned Mineral and Metals Trading Corp signed its first long - term export agreement with the company , but gave no further details .
Of the plant ' s 800 , 000 tonnes annual capacity , 425 , 000 will be smelted into 218 , 000 tonnes of aluminium and the remaining 375 , 000 will be exported , the official said .
U . S .
LEADING INDEX FELL 1 . 0 PCT IN JANUARY The U . S . index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1 . 0 pct in January after a revised 2 . 3 pct December gain , the Commerce Department said .
The department previously said the index rose 2 . 1 pct in December .
The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July , 1984 , when the index fell 1 . 7 pct .
The January decrease left the index at 183 . 8 over its 1967 base of 100 , and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment .
A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline .
Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment , they were building permits , manufacturers ' new orders for consumer goods , a change in sensitive materials prices , slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance .
Four of 10 indicators were positive , including stock prices , new business formation , average work week and money supply .
The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation .
There was no revision in the 0 . 9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November .
The index of coincident indicators , which measures the current economy , fell 0 . 1 pct in January after increases of 0 . 7 pct in December and 0 . 2 pct in November .
The index of lagging indicators , which measures past economic activity , rose 0 . 5 pct in January after a decrease of 0 . 5 pct in December and an increase of 0 . 2 pct in November .

BP UNITS SEEK FIVE BILLION DLR REVOLVING CREDIT BP International and BP North America are seeking a five billion dlr , four year syndicated credit facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc ' s tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own , Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger .
The facility , to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP . L > is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in Europe , bond analysts said .
Full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning .
BP said earlier it planned a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own for 70 dlrs a share cash .
The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit .
As announced earlier , BP also is arranging a U . S . Commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program .
The exact size of the U . S .
Program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen .
The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one , three or six months through a tender panel , which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility .
Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility , Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among BP ' s relationship banks .
As a result , banks were being offered lead manager status at 200 mln dlrs , co - lead management at 125 mln and manager at 75 mln .
Although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition to win mandates , Morgan Guaranty said banks would be compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly , with signing expected in about 10 days .

EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION The rebates granted at yesterday ' s EC sugar tender represent a further concession to producers ' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc , trade sources said .
They said the maximum rebate of 45 . 678 European currency Units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos was 0 . 87 Ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention .
The rebate at last week ' s tender was 1 . 3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2 . 5 Ecus below this level .
But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers .
The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores .
The five - week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it .
EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar , it is determined immediately to resell it , a move which could drive down market prices further .

GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN FEBRUARY West Germany ' s current account surplus widened to a provisional 6 . 6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4 . 8 billion in January , a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said .
The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10 . 4 billion marks from 7 . 2 billion in January , she added .
The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4 . 9 billion marks .
The February trade surplus was well up on the 6 . 84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986 .
But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6 . 85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986 .
A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors .
Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted .
February imports , measured in terms of value , totalled 32 . 11 billion marks , a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5 . 5 pct against January .
Exports in February , also in value terms , totalled 42 . 56 billion marks , 0 . 5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January .
The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February .
But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year - on - year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4 . 4 pct .
Within the current account , the services account had 300 mln marks deficit , supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3 . 7 billion mark deficit .
Taking the first two months of 1987 together , imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62 . 6 billion marks compared with a year earlier .
The value of exports totalled 80 . 2 billion marks , a decline of 7 . 4 pct against the same months of 1986 .
The resulting trade surplus of 17 . 6 billion marks for January / February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14 . 1 billion marks in the year - ago period .
The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11 . 3 billion marks against 11 . 4 billion marks a year earlier , the Statistics Office said .
Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors .
The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0 . 7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged .
" The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least ," said an economist .
He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112 . 2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks .
An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft ( BfG ) in Frankfurt said a two - month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany ' s trade position .
He noted the 17 . 6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21 . 6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December .
" The trend is clearly lower ," he said .
This economist , who declined to be named , said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January , when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather , both of which hindered trade .
KEATING REVISES DOWN AUSTRALIAN GROWTH FORECAST Treasurer Paul Keating forecast economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year ending June this year , down from the 2 . 25 pct forecast contained in the 1986 / 87 budget delivered last August .
Australia ' s terms of trade also fell , by 18 pct , over the past two years , he told Parliament .
Terms of trade are the difference between import and export price indexes .
Despite the figures , the budget forecast of about 1 . 75 pct annual growth in employment would be met , Keating said .
Unemployment is currently at 8 . 2 pct of the workforce .
" This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War ," Keating said .
" We are not pushing this place into a recession .
We are not only holding our gains on unemployment , we are bringing unemployment down ," he said , adding that the government had help the country avoid recession .
TAIWAN ' S SAVINGS AT RECORD HIGH Taiwan has over one trillion Taiwan dlrs in savings , official statistics show .
Figures released yesterday show all forms of savings by individuals and public and private firms , including bank deposits , certificates of deposits and bond ' s , are running at about 37 pct of gross national product ( GNP ).
GNP rose by 14 . 35 pct in 1986 to 2 . 74 trillion dlrs .
Taiwan ' s strict foreign exchange controls and lack of incentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings are mainly deposited in bank savings accounts , earning below four pct interest each year .
SHORT - DATED SAUDI RIYAL RATES FIRM IN QUIET MARKET Short - dated Saudi riyal interest rates firmed but other rates were steady in quiet trading , dealers said .
" Day - to - day money is a bit tighter ," one trader said .
Overnight rose two points to six pct , while most quotes for tomorrow / next and spot / next were 1 / 2 point higher at around six , 5 - 1 / 2 pct .
The periods were essentially steady at 5 - 7 / 8 , 5 / 8 pct for one month , 6 - 1 / 2 , 3 / 8 pct for three , and 6 - 7 / 8 , 11 / 16 for six months .
The spot riyal stood at 3 . 7500 / 05 to the dollar after 3 . 7506 / 09 yesterday .
JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND Japan ' s plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system , Japanese and U . S . Industry sources said .
" Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers ' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal ," a Housewives Association of Japan official said .
Despite mounting U . S . Pressure on Japan to open farm markets , beef is strictly controlled by the government , which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers .
Under the plan , expected to be announced this month , the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1 , 370 yen per kilo for 1987 / 88 against 1 , 400 now , and the ceiling at 1 , 780 yen against 1 , 820 .
The standard price of other beef , mainly produced from dairy steers , is set at 1 , 020 yen against 1 , 090 and the ceiling at 1 , 325 against 1 , 420 .
Ministry officials said the semi - government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp ( LIPC ) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone .
The LIPC is allowed to import most beef , with the amount set by the government under a quota system .
When wholesale prices go above the ceiling , the LIPC releases its beef stocks , both domestic and imported , and buys locally produced beef when prices are below .
But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling .
Phillip Seng , Asian Director of the U . S . Meat Export Federation , told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices , about half those in Japan .
But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U . S . Meat exporters because of Japan ' s rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC .
The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs , as well as poor operations by the LIPC .
American meat packers see Japan as a promising market .
F . C .
Beatty , of U . S . Packer John Morrell and Co , told the Japan Times beef cuts , which sell for 1 . 20 to 3 . 00 dlrs a pound in the U . S ., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan .

But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp reduction in intervention prices .
U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month .
In 1984 , Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9 , 000 tonnes a year until March 31 , 1988 .
In 1987 / 88 , the quota will rise to 177 , 000 tonnes from 168 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , ministry officials said , adding Japan wants to keep self - sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct .
FOREIGN FIRMS HOPE TO JOIN JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY One of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan ' s international telecommunications market said it will offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms .
President of & lt ; International Telecom Japan Inc > ( ITJ ), Nobuo Ito , decline to specify what share the firms would take , but told Reuters they would not participate in its management .
ITJ and & lt ; International Digital Communications Planning Inc > ( IDC ), in which both Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L > and Pacific Telesis Group & lt ; PAC . N > own 20 pct stakes , are set to merge into a new entity to compete against & lt ; Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd > ( KDD ).
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged the two rival firms to merge so KDD would have only a single competitor .
The ministry has also rejected foreign management .
Japan ' s law limits foreign ownership of any new international telecommunications entrant to 33 pct , so C and W ' s and Pacific ' s stakes could be three pct in the merged firm , sources said .
Those seeking to join are General Electric Co & lt ; GE . N >, Ford Motor Co & lt ; F . N >, & lt ; Citibank NA >, BankAmerica Corp & lt ; BAC . NYSE >, & lt ; Shearson Lehman Bros Inc >, & lt ; Saloman Brothers >, & lt ; Asia Boeing Computer Service >, Unisys Corp & lt ; UIS . N >, & lt ; Societe Generale > and Deutsche Bank AG & lt ; DBKG . FRA >.
The merger plan has been criticised for excluding foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market .
The U . K .' s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , U . S . Secretary of State George Shultz , U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have all expressed such opposition .
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will draft a reply to the criticism following further discussion , a Posts and Ministry official said .

SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR World group turnover of Siemens AG & lt ; SIEG . F > should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months , management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said .
Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985 / 86 of 47 . 02 billion marks .
Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21 . 2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986 / 87 , about 19 pct above the same year - ago period .
The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct .
In the first five 1986 / 87 months , turnover abroad showed a three pct increase , Kaske said , without giving figures .
In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21 . 8 billion marks against the same 1985 / 86 period .
For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion .
Apart from payments for the nuclear power station , the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year , Kaske said .
But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986 / 87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar , Kaske said .
Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986 / 87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year .
Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology , communications and telecommunications sectors , but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline .
Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10 . 2 billion marks in the first five months of this year , or nine pct above their level in the same 1985 / 86 period , boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary .
Foreign orders grew one pct to 11 . 6 billion marks .
An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar .
While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders , energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985 / 86 .
Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level .
Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986 / 87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year .
Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6 . 1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover .
KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS The Fried .
Krupp GmbH & lt ; KRPG . D > steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18 . 1 billion marks from 20 . 7 billion the previous year .
Third party turnover declined to 15 . 9 billion from 18 . 5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15 . 5 billion marks from 16 . 9 billion , it said in a preliminary statement .
Despite these figures , which reflected the dollar ' s weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls , it said 1986 was a satisfactory year .
The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector , which accounted for 42 pct of total sales .
Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities .
An orders decline in the steel and , in particular , the trading and services sectors , affected the group ' s total order figures .
However , " all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986 ," Krupp added , without giving details .
Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9 . 6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5 . 9 billion , it said .
Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985 .
Orders received by the machinery and plant sector , 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group , rose by four mln marks last year to 6 . 9 billion , Krupp said .
The group ' s orders in hand amounted to 9 . 1 billion marks at end - December 1986 from 10 . 3 billion at the start of the year .
Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6 . 2 billion marks from 1985 , it said .
The steel market weakened increasingly over the year , mainly because of exchange rate movements , the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries .
The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct , Krupp said .
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold - rolled flats , grew by five pct in tonnage terms .
NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS , MINISTRY Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark ' s strength the Economics Ministry said .
The ministry ' s parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg , told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987 , reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid - 1986 .
But even if the turnaround did not occur , there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand .
Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate .
" This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps ," he said .
The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade , he added .
Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities .
Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness , he said , adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards , prompt delivery times and good service .
Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures .
It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus , but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark ' s strength on the country ' s exporters .
Reports about the trade surplus , especially overseas , tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures , which rose to a record 112 . 2 billion marks in 1986 , he said .
But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices .
German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime , he said .
MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention , dealers said .
The dollar ' s fall below 150 yen , which follows last month ' s Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U . S ., Japan , West Germany , Britain , France and Canada , is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five ( G - 5 ) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar , they said .
The G - 5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides , dealers said .
Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G - 5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States , Japan , Britain and West Germany , they said .
Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar .
The dollar was sold anyway .
Yesterday ' s comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment , dealers said .
The intervention , backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita , which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt , has done little but slow the rate of its decline , they noted .
The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today ' s huge currency markets .
Dealers said the market ' s cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars .
" This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand ," said Koichi Miyazaki , deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank .
Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen .
The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149 . 40 against New York ' s 149 . 30 / 40 .
Its record low was 148 . 40 in Tokyo last Tuesday .
Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again .
The market expects the seven nations ( the Paris six plus Italy ) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention , a chief dealer at a U . S . Bank said .
Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations , particulary the U . S ., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U . S . Trade deficit , especially with Japan .
Further pressure from a protectionist U . S . Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington ' s options , they said .
The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall , not to push it back over 150 yen , said Tadahiko Nashimoto , manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan .
Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September .
The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation , dealers said .
Yesterday ' s request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand , they said .
The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1 , dealers said .
" The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen ," one dealer said .
The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen , he said .
Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen , it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145 .

MALAYSIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES HIGHER 1987 GROWTH Gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1 . 5 and two pct , up from one pct in 1986 , the central bank said .
The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October .
Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product ( GNP ) is expected to grow by 3 . 5 to four pct , after declining 7 . 3 pct in 1986 .
It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports .
Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2 . 5 to three pct , it added .
Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15 . 50 dlrs a barrel , rubber at 210 cents a kilo , palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne , tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports .
It said Malaysia ' s international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985 .
" In 1987 , income will be higher , private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand ...
The budget will remain under strict control ...
The resource gap in the government ' s finances on current account will be bridged over the near term ," Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report .
The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1 . 19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1 . 8 pct of GNP from 1 . 79 billion or 2 . 5 pct of the GNP the previous year .
The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1 . 5 pct , after its 0 . 7 pct rise in 1986 .
COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS This morning ' s sharp decline in coffee prices , following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization , ICO , quotas , will be short - lived , Dutch roasters said .
" The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas , but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again ," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said .
" The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present , there is a shortage of quality ," he said .
" Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks ," the roaster added .
Dutch Coffee Roasters ' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction , it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis .
" There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement ," he said .
" There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation ," de Vries added .
With this in mind , and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover , the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand - to - mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb , roasters said .

VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY Britain ' s visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January , The Trade and Industry Department said .
The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January .
Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus , the same as in January .
Seasonally adjusted , imports rose in February to 7 . 16 billion stg from 6 . 73 billion in January .
Exports rose to a record 6 . 93 billion last month from 6 . 20 billion in January .
Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain ' s current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected .
The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures .
The seasonally adjusted volume index , base 1980 , a guide to underlying non - oil trade , showed exports rising to 131 . 0 from 114 . 6 in January and imports rising to 142 . 2 from 136 . 5 .
The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln .
The Department said the upward trend in non - oil export volume continues and the underlying level of non - oil import volume seems to have stablised .
The Departnment said exports to the U . S . May be benefiting from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates .
LUCAS SEES CONTINUED GROWTH IN SECOND HALF Lucas Industries Plc & lt ; LUCS . L > said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U . K . Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North American electronics .
The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax profit to 40 mln in the six months to end - January .
The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557 . 5p at 1130 GMT from last night ' s close of 590p .
It said it would continue with plans for all its activities to be internationally competitive and profitable .
Costs of restructuring , reorganisation , employee training and retraining , particularly in the UK automotive businesses , together with high research and development spending would affect profits in the short term .
But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in automotive markets , especially in vehicle breaking and engine management systems .
Recent acquisitions in North America had strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems .

TRADE SURPLUS CUT WOULD BENEFIT JAPAN - SUMITA Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said it is in Japan ' s national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus .
He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem .
To this end , Japan and the U . S . Must make medium - and long - term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations .
World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries ' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue , he added .

U . K . MONEY MARKET FORECAST REVISED TO DEFICIT The Bank of England said it revised its estimate of today ' s money market shortfall to around 350 mln stg from a flat position .
IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council ( IWC ) lifted its estimate for 1986 / 87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1 , 377 mln , compared with 1 , 351 mln tonnes the previous season .
In its monthly market report , the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987 / 88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986 / 87 .
The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986 / 87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments .
The IWC raised the 1986 / 87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes .
It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln .
The IWC 1986 / 87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere .
The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987 / 88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect .
At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries .
There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off .
Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook , the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada .
U . S . Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise .
After damage to its maize crop last year , the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops .
Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987 , the IWC said .
Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986 / 87 , the IWC said .
It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes , respectively , against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier .
After record world durum wheat production of 218 . 8 mln tonnes last season , the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC , Canada , the U . S . And North Africa .
BANK OF JAPAN BUYS SMALL QUANTITY DOLLARS - DEALERS The Bank of Japan was thought to have bought a small amount of dollars at around 149 . 30 / 40 yen , dealers said .
The dollar fluctuated marginally after the small - scale intervention , believed to total several tens of mlns of dlrs , they said .
Large - scale buying by foreign banks or by a life insurance company earlier pushed the dollar upwards , they said .
Trading was not very active and dealers were watching for further central bank intervention to smooth out any sharp movements , but underlying dollar sentiment is still bearish .
U . K . TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT The release of U . K . February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg , up from a 73 mln surplus in January , has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates , analysts said .
Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome , with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg , against the official figure of 224 mln stg , sharply narrower than January ' s 527 mln deficit .
" The figures are unreservedly good ," Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said .
Sterling rebounded on the trade figures , reversing a weaker morning trend , to stand at 72 . 1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday , unchanged from yesterday ' s close but 0 . 3 points above the 1100 GMT level .
The market had feared that a deteriorating non - oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling , which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U . K . Interest rates .
Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9 . 5 pct from the present 10 . 0 pct was really on the cards .
But sentiment now looks to have turned about again .
There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2 . 5 billion stg will be exceeded , Wroblewski said .
Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7 . 16 billion stg from 6 . 73 billion in January .
Exports rose to a record 6 . 93 billion from 6 . 20 billion .
However , Chris Tinker , U . K . Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months .
He forecast the Chancellor ' s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods .
However , Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data , cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1 . 75 billion stg .
He said news of strong growth in exports of non - oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry .
The growth in imports appears to be flattening , even if January ' s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import - intensive stock building among manufacturers , Harwood said .
U . K . Government bonds , or gilts , surged by more than 1 / 2 point on the better - than - expected news , as earlier worries about the figures evaporated .
Sterling peaked at a high of 1 . 6075 dlrs , before settling to a steady 1 . 6050 about 1300 GMT , nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1 . 5960 .
However , analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news .
Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government ' s support was slipping .
LONDON , March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning , buying bank bills in band two at 9 - 13 / 16 pct .
Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln stg .
GERMAN NET CURRENCY RESERVES RISE West German net currency reserves rose by 300 mln marks in the third week of March to 82 . 0 billion , following a fall of 5 . 4 billion marks in the previous week , the Bundesbank said .
Non - currency reserves were unchanged at about 2 . 5 billion marks , bringing net monetary reserves to 84 . 5 billion .
CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSS PUSHES MALAYSIA ' S DEBT UP An exchange loss of 7 . 6 billion ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia ' s outstanding external debt up to 50 . 99 billion ringgit , from 1985 ' s 42 . 3 billion , the Central Bank said in its annual report .
Bank Negara said although Malaysia ' s net borrowing dropped in 1986 , its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged .
The basket comprises principally the U . S . Dollar , yen , mark , Swiss franc , French franc , sterling , guilder , Canadian and Singapore dollars , it added .
Bank Negara said growth in external debt , which declined progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13 . 6 pct in 1985 , rose by 20 . 2 pct in 1986 .
Malaysia ' s debt serving ratio of 17 . 6 pct of its exports in 1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct , Bank Negara Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters .
IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success , the International Wheat Council ( IWC ) says in its latest monthly report .
Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas , as employed in the United States , the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina , Australia , Canada , the EC and the U . S .
In some countries , for example Australia and Argentina , which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income , there may be problems in reducing production .
A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment , with job prospects outside agriculture limited .
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems .
The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries .
They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated .
Alternatively , support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold , without needing to be stored for a long period .
This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production , the report said .
The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture , possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production .
The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 .
At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses .
These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency .
For example between 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 . 30 to 179 . 44 European currency units ( Ecus ).
It dollar terms , the currency in which most export transactions are denominated , the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 .
The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure , the report says .
The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 .
This was partly due to increased production in China and India .
The period saw an upward trend in yields , although this was countered in the Argentina , the U . S . And Australia by lower acreages .
In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises , particularly livestock while lower U . S . Acreages are attributed to official incentives .
U . S . TREASURY ' S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead .
" I don ' t think it ' s ( a tax increase ) is a very good idea and I ' m quite confident that President Reagan doesn ' t think it ' s a very good idea ," Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network ' s " Moneyline " television program .
He said U . S . taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been , but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP .
Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits .
Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright , D - Tex , or other special taxes .
" The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take ," the Treasury Secretary said .
He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency .
On the international front , Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries .
He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor ' s Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies , largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure .
Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States .
He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries .
The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations ' " investment regimes do not support enough equity investment , so you ' ve got to have some debt there .
" Commenting on the U . S . trade deficit , Baker said " I think you ' re going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year .
"
TREASURY ' S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels .
" I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals ," Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview .
" We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it ," he said .
Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to " co - operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels .
" He refused to comment directly on the current yen / dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended " to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say .
" Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U . S . currency , a statement that triggered this week ' s renewed decline of the dollar .
" I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co - ordination is alive and well ," Baker said .
The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances .
He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also " been very outspoken " in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can .
GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD RISING IN 2ND HALF 1987 The price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand , West German analysts said .
Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year , said Peter Witte , director of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale ' s trading division , after a presentation by the U . S . Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins .
" A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges ," Witte said , adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs .
Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411 . 30 dlrs .
Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks , many investors still want to buy physical gold , Witte said .
Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver .
Hermann Strohmeyer , vice president of Commerzbank AG ' s foreign exchange trading and treasury department , said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year .
The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce , and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year , he said .

GULF ESCORTS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION - WEINBERGER No action has been taken yet on the Reagan Adminstration ' s offer to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Gulf , but the issue is being discussed , U . S . Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said .
The offer was made to Kuwait in light of Iran ' s deployment of Chinese - built missiles to cover the entrance to the Gulf .
Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas Christian University that he did not think Iran and the United States were moving towards a potential conflict , adding that the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still " free water .

FIRST INTERSTATE & lt ; I > ESTIMATES LOSS ON BRAZIL First Interstate Bancorp Chairman Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16 mln dlrs per year , after taxes , if it had to put its medium and long - term debt on non - accrual status .
In an interview , he said that could result in about a 4 . 5 pct decline in annual earnings per share .
Pinola said First Interstate , like other banks , has not yet decided to put the loans , which Brazil stopped paying interest on last month , on non - accrual status .
" None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might be going on ," he said .
First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in medium - to long - term loans to Brazil .
It said on December 31 , 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian outstanding debt totaled about 4 . 1 mln dlrs .
First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short - term loans or trade lines to Brazil .
Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt crisis will be more political than economic , which he said he finds , " very disquieting and discomforting .

HEINZ INTERESTED IN BUYING GUINNESS BREWING H . J .
Heinz & lt ; HNZ . N > chairman Tony O ' Reilly would be interested in buying Guinness PLC & lt ; GUIN . L >' s brewery division if it were for sale , a spokesman said .
The spokesman , reacting to Irish and British press reports , said " He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale .
But he has not put together a consortium , nor has he been buying shares .
" He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile .
In the magazine article , he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts , the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts .
" A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation ," he said .
" This would mean an expensive exercise , right on the edge , but not impossible ," he added .
The deal would mean buying the Dublin , London , Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because " It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all ," O ' Reilly said .

FRENCH RESERVES FALL ON DEBT REPAYMENT French reserves fell in the week ended March 19 following repayment of the bulk of the debt contracted during January with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund , the Bank of France said in its weekly statement .
The repayment of capital and interest on this loan , taken out during the strong pressure on the franc which preceded the European Monetary System ( EMS ) realignment and the subsequent Group of Five meeting in Paris , took place on March 13 .
It comprised the repayment of 11 . 25 billion francs ' worth of European Currency Units ( ECUs ), 9 . 72 billion francs ' worth of foreign currency and 1 . 72 billion francs ' worth of special drawing rights ( SDRs ), the Bank said .
As a result foreign currency reserves fell to 114 . 69 billion francs on March 19 from 120 . 82 billion on March 12 , while ECU reserves fell to 62 . 02 billion francs from 73 . 23 billion .
Gold reserves remained stable at 218 . 32 billion francs .

Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about 45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its business , including adjustments to reflect the market value of transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves for inventory , receivables and excess facilities .
Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will also include restructuring costs of about 5 , 500 , 000 dlrs , in addition to the 45 mln dlr charge .
Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating in technical default under its lease of transponders on the Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain agreed - upon financial ratios .
It said it is in talks with the lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations .
Further , Equitorial said it is in default of two other oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of transponders as a result of cross - default provisions .
Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for Contel Corp & lt ; CTC > to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial master earth stations , micro earth stations and associated equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six - month period for repayment starting in December 1988 .
The company said Conteol , under the agreement , would assume a portion of Equatorial ' s rights and obligations under the Galaxy III transponder lease with & lt ; Burnham Leasing > on the occurrence of certain events .
Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy about 3 , 600 , 000 common shares at 3 . 25 dlrs each .
Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject to Equatorial ' s ability to restructure a significant portion of its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and lessors , in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease .
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15 .

BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS The Bank of Spain provided 1 , 145 billion pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight rates .
The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last June 6 of 1 , 240 billion pesetas .
A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing money supply figures for February .
The M - 4 money supply , measured as liquid assets in public hands , rose 16 . 7 pct last month against 8 . 1 pct in January and compared with this year ' s eight pct target .
Money supply growth was 11 . 4 pct last year .
The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas .
Rates stood at 12 . 1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds .
" The policy is proving counter - productive and rates will have to come down in the long - term ," the bank spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries .
He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short - term speculative capital from abroad .
" At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other countries with much lower rates ," he said .
ETHYL CORP & lt ; EY > UNITS COMPLETE ACQUISITON Ethyl Corp said its subsidiaries completed the acquisiton of Nelson Research and Development Co & lt ; NELR >.

It added that Nelson , based in Irvine , Calif ., will be operated as a wholly - owned subsidiary of Ethyl .
Nelson designs and develops new drugs , Ethyl said .
BRITISH POLITICIANS URGE JAPAN TRADE SANCTIONS One hundred members of Britain ' s ruling Conservative Party have signed a motion calling for trade sanctions against Japan to force Tokyo to open its domestic market to British goods .
The government announced last week that Japan had a 5 . 9 billion dlr trade surplus with Britain in 1986 .
The Department of Trade and Industry said the government was drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening up its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very much a last resort .
Ideas being considered included blocking Japanese companies from trading in Britain and revoking licenses of Japanese operations in the London financial district .
U . K . TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT The release of U . K . February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg , up from a 73 mln surplus in January , has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates , analysts said .
Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome , with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg , against the official figure of 224 mln stg , sharply narrower than January ' s 527 mln deficit .
" The figures are unreservedly good ," Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said .
Sterling rebounded on the trade figures , reversing a weaker morning trend , to stand at 72 . 1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday , unchanged from yesterday ' s close but 0 . 3 points above the 1100 GMT level .
The market had feared that a deteriorating non - oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling , which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U . K . Interest rates .
Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9 . 5 pct from the present 10 . 0 pct was really on the cards .
But sentiment now looks to have turned about again .
There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2 . 5 billion stg will be exceeded , said Wroblewski .
Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7 . 16 billion stg from 6 . 73 billion in January .
Exports rose to a record 6 . 93 billion from 6 . 20 billion .
However , Chris Tinker , U . K . Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months .
He forecast the Chancellor ' s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods .
However , Ian Harwood , economist at Warburg Securities , said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data , cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1 . 75 billion stg .
He said news of strong growth in exports of non - oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry .
The growth in imports appears to be flattening , even if January ' s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import - intensive stock building among manufactureres , Harwood said .
U . K . Government bonds , or gilts , surged by more than 1 / 2 point on the better - than - expected news , as earlier worries about the figures evaporated .
Sterling peaked at a high of 1 . 6075 dlrs , before settling to a steady 1 . 6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT , nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1 . 5960 .
However , analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news .
Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government ' s support was slipping .
The Marplan poll , published in " Today ," showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct , from 38 pct last month , while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct , from 21 pct , to run neck and neck with the Labour Party , whose own support fell from 38 pct .
The poll was taken after the Budget , which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent , political observers said .
Another regular poll is due tomorrow , and eonomists warn that today ' s improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again .
This upsetting of the markets ' political perceptions , which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election , made them more sensitive to the trade data , Harwood said .
" The news did come as a very , very substantial relief ," he said .
However , on the interest rate front , economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall .
They noted Lawson had already got an inflation - reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates , so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed .
S . KOREA MAY BUY U . S . OIL TO AID TRADE BALANCE South Korea is studying a plan to buy more coal from the United States and to start importing Alaskan crude oil to help reduce its huge trade surplus with the United States , Energy Ministry officials said today .
They said the plan would dominate discussions at two - day energy talks between officials of the two countries in Washington from April 1 .
Huh Sun - yong , who will attend the talks with three other Seoul government officials , told Reuters that Seoul was " positively considering buying a certain amount of Alaskan oil beginning this year as part of our government ' s overall plan to reduce a widening trade gap between the two countries .
" Huh said however that South Korean refineries considered the Alaskan oil economically uncompetitive .

GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD FIRMING LATER THIS YEAR The price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand , West German analysts said .
Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year , said Peter Witte , director of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale ' s trading division , after a presentation by the U . S . Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins .
" A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges ," Witte said , adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs .
Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411 . 30 dlrs .
Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks , many investors still want to buy physical gold , Witte said .
Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver .
Hermann Strohmeyer , vice president of Commerzbank AG ' s foreign exchange trading and treasury department , said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year .
The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce , and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year , he said .
U . K . MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 226 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it operated in the money market this afternoon , buying 226 mln stg in bills .

This brings total money market help so far today to 241 mln stg and compares with the Bank ' s revised estimate of a 350 mln stg shortfall .

CAROLIAN SYSTEMS SEES LOWER FISCAL 1987 PROFIT & lt ; Carolian Systems International Inc > said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410 , 000 dlrs , despite an expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3 . 5 mln dlrs .
After an extraordinary expense associated with the December , 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering , " we expect to be modestly profitable for the year , but below the 410 , 000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986 ," the company said .
Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of 12 , 933 dlrs , excluding an extraordinary loss of 17 , 210 dlrs , compared to earnings of 69 , 829 dlrs in the prior year .
The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be lower due to withdrawal of its share offering , computer equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff expansion .
A strengthening Canadian dollar against U . S . currency will also adversely affect revenues and earnings , since 85 pct of revenues are generated by sales outside Canada , said Carolian , a leading supplier of utility software for Hewlett - Packard computer systems .

U . S TREASURY ' S MULFORD REAFFIRMS G - 6 AGREEMENT Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford reaffirmed U . S . backing for the Paris Agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels .
In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee , Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that " further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects .
" But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation , " We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges .
" Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments .
He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives " or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention " would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures , he said .
Accordingly , Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive .
Commenting on the trade deficit , Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year , due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months .
But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U . S . efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U . S . competitiveness .
He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate .
FRENCH FREE MARKET CEREAL EXPORT BIDS DETAILED French operators have requested licences to export 675 , 500 tonnes of maize , 245 , 000 tonnes of barley , 22 , 000 tonnes of soft bread wheat and 20 , 000 tonnes of feed wheat at today ' s European Community tender , traders said .
Rebates requested ranged from 127 . 75 to 132 . 50 European Currency Units a tonne for maize , 136 . 00 to 141 . 00 Ecus a tonne for barley and 134 . 25 to 141 . 81 Ecus for bread wheat , while rebates requested for feed wheat were 137 . 65 Ecus , they said .
U . S . GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 3 . 1 MLN OUNCES American Eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3 . 1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market , well above the target of 2 . 2 mln , Donna Pope , director of the U . S . Mint , told journalists .
World sales , which began on October 20 , 1986 , reached 2 . 193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales .
This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986 , Pope said .
Pope said that in volume terms , nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America , roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia .
She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently , the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle ' s strong market share with extensive publicity .
The Mint uses mainly newly mined U . S . Gold for the coins , as long as this is available at market prices .
The remaining gold is taken either from U . S . Treasury stocks , or from the open market , Pope said .
Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf , and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand .
Some estimated the Maple Leaf ' s West German market share at 60 pct .
The figures may be distorted , as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value - added tax imposed here .
Including the tax , the one - ounce coins traded today at 906 marks , they said .
Competition may also come from new gold coins , including Belgium ' s ECU , which began sales today .
Britain and Australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins , the analysts said .

FOOTHILL GROUP & lt ; FGI > SEES BETTER FIRST QUARTER Don Gevirtz , chairman of The Foothill Group Inc , told Reuters the company ' s first quarter results will be up sharply over last year ' s eight cents a share .
" First quarter results will be dramatically better ," he said following a presentation to analysts .
He cited a sharp drop in non - earning assets , healthy asset growth and lower expenses .
He declined to predict specific results for the first quarter .
In the 1986 first quarter , the commerical finance company earned 606 , 000 dlrs , or eight cts per share .
Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results , but said , " We expect an excellent year .
" In 1986 Foothill earned 3 , 239 , 000 dlrs , or 41 cts per share .
Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85 cts a share in 1987 .
During the presentation Gevirtz said Foothill has reduced to less than five pct the company ' s level of non - performing assets , which was as high as eight pct in previous years .
David Hilton , chief financial officer , said the company ' s general and administrative expenses in 1987 will be reduced to about 3 . 0 to 3 . 5 pct of average assets from 4 . 3 pct in 1986 .
The company had average assets of 399 . 8 mln dlrs from continuing operations and 29 . 8 mln dlrs from discontinued operations in 1986 , according to its annual report .
BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS , SELLS YEN - DEALERS The Bank of France intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U . S . Currency , dealers said .
A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen .
A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention , to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month ' s meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris .
The dollar was being quoted at 6 . 0950 / 70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6 . 09425 francs .
The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149 . 28 against the dollar .
The U . S . Currency was subsequently being quoted at 149 . 25 / 35 .
The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar .
Pressure developed after U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan administration had no targets for the dollar , apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies .
Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted .
STANDARD & lt ; SRD > REFERRING BP & lt ; BP > BID TO GROUP Standard Oil Co said British Petroleum Co Plc ' s proposed offer of 70 dlrs a share for the 45 pct of Standard ' s stock not held by BP is being referred to a special committee of the company ' s board .
This committee , which is composed of the independent , non - exective directors of the company , was formed in April 1986 for the purpose of monitoring the relationship between Standard Oil and BP .

ANCHOR GLASS & lt ; AGLS > NOW SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR NET Anchor Glass Container Corp said first quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3 . 1 mln dlrs earned before extraordinary items in the year earlier quarter .
Previously , the company had said first quarter results would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to production disruptions caused by the large number of production line changes scheduled during the first quarter , its statement pointed out .
While the disruptive effects of the production line changes had occurred in line with expectations , Anchor Glass said , first quarter operating results were helped by lower than anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a result of a more favorable product mix .
The company said its income performance for the full year remains very good .
It also said Anchor Hocking Corp & lt ; ARH > has converted the entire principal balance of its Anchor Glass convertible subordinated note to 576 , 694 Anchor Glass common shares .
Anchor Glass said the conversion decreased its total debt and increased stockholders ' equity by about 9 . 4 mln dlrs and increased common shares outstanding to 13 , 902 , 716 .
It said the conversion will also reduce its annualized net interest expense by about 1 . 1 mln dlrs , or 600 , 000 dlrs after taxes .

The company said a definitive merger agreement is expected to be negotiated within six weeks and shareholders are expected to vote on the deal at a meeting expected to be held in June or July .
ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise , said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors .
Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years , the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re - melted material increasingly attractive .
It takes around 15 , 000 kilowatt hours ( kwh ) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal , Shearson said .
On the demand side , developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption .
Automobile production , although expected to fall this year , is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and , in addition , use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry , particularly in the U . S .
In packaging , Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U . S ., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries .
In addition to the cost savings involved , technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry , Shearson said .
There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U . S . Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries , albeit on a smaller scale .

DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co - responsibility levy is applied , a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association , Het Comite , told Reuters .
Het Comite has been co - ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and , since December , has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague .
The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross - rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country .
Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board .
The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague .
Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10 .
The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged " because the bill ( the firm ) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins .
" The name of the company is not being made public .
The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future .
The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg , and " as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved .
" Meanwhile , the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected , the spokesman said .
Het Comite , as a member of FEFAC , the association of European animal feed manufacturers , is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court .

U . S . ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS The U . S .
Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years , visiting U . S . Under - Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito , Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations ( Keidanren ), a spokesman for Keidanren said .
The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress .
Wallis , who is attending a sub - cabinet - level bilateral trade meeting , made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito .
Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U . S . Trade bill is a moderate one , rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country .
He was also quoted as saying the U . S . Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three , the spokesman said .
Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products .

MULFORD SAYS G - 6 WANTS STABILITY Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce " reasonable stability " in exchange markets over the next few months .
He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to " see if there can ' t be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility " to give time for the committments in Paris to take place .
Asked by Sen Phil Gramm ( R - Tex ) whether U . S . intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar , Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments , current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals .
In particular , the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U . S . to cut its budget deficit , Mulford said in his testimony .
He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth .
Mulford noted that half of West Germany ' s economy was affected by international developments .
He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U . S . exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U . S ., as Gramm asserted , if Japan reformed its domestic capital market .
Commenting on the Paris agreement , Mulford said , " I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so ( Germany ' s and Japan ' s ) efforts can be carried out .
Mulford rejected Gramm ' s argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar .
Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U . S . trade deficit .
Otherwise , he said , the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U . S . recession , both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable .

Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition , the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses charged against 1986 operations .

U . S . SENATE HITS EC OILS TAX , VOWS RETALIATION The Senate voted to condemn the proposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation .
The non - binding Senate resolution , a sense of Senate sentiment , was approved on a 99 to 0 vote .
" The administration should communicate to the European Community the message that the United States will view the establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European Community ' s obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and immediate countermeasures ," the resolution stated .
The resolution said the European Community Commission has proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices for the 1987 / 1988 EC marketing year .
The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of the current price of soyoil and " have a restrictive effect " on U . S . exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC .
It would be " blatantly inconsistent " with obligations of the EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , GATT , the resolution said , and " constitute another egregious attempt " to impose EC agricultural costs on trading partners .

BANK OF BOSTON EXPECTS 1ST QTR EARNINGS FROM 90 CTS TO 1 . 00 DLRS / SHR VS 79 CTS
BANK OF BOSTON & lt ; BKB > SEES IMPROVED 1ST QUARTER Bank of Boston Corp expects first quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share , up from 79 cts a share last year , Chairman William Brown said .
He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt payments .
If a default does occur , it would first quarter earnings by about five cts a share , which would bring the bank ' s in the lower level of the estimated range , he added .
Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year .
Brown said the bank ' s other nonperforming assets , not including its Brazilian exposure , could rise to over 700 mln dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 .
He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company recovers from an earthquake earlier this year .
Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit problems .
Brown said the Bank of Boston remains " cautiously optimitic about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be on nonaccural all year .
" In 1986 , the bank earned 3 . 69 dlrs a share , or 232 . 8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1 . 08 billion dlrs .
President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders ' s meeting the bank ' s total loans to Argentina , Brazil and Mexico totaled 875 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 , 37 pct of its primary capital .
Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs , of which about two - thirds are affected by its suspension of interest payments on its medium and long term foreign debt .

FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U . S . government securities market to add reserves during its usual intervention period today , economists said .
With federal funds trading at a steady 6 - 3 / 16 pct , most economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves via a medium - sized round of customer repurchase agreements .
However , some economists said the Fed may arrange more aggressive system repurchase agreements .
Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass early this afternoon .
Such action had been widely anticipated yesterday but failed to materialize .
DOLLAR / YEN INTERVENTION RESPONDS TO PRESSURE The Bank of France intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month ' s meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada , foreign exchange dealers said .
But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation .
A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday .
Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan .
The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two - way operations , not necessarily on its own account , but to counter short - term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31 .
One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149 . 28 to the dollar .
Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market , a departure from the central bank ' s usual insistence on confidentiality .
But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention , which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale .
" Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs , you would still be talking of a small overall amount ," said one dealer .
Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year - end window dressing demand for yen .
" This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend ," the dealer said .
Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar ' s trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen .
These ranges were set in February ' s stabilisation agreement reached here by U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan , Germany , France , Britain and Canada .
But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar .
Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down , telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement .
Foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments , he said .

NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS & lt ; Norcen Energy Resources Ltd >, 41 pct owned by & lt ; Hees International Corp >, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987 , even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels .
The improvement will result from production increases , lower taxes and royalties , reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986 , the company said in the annual report .
Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings , excluding a 20 . 1 mln dlr writeoff , declined by 58 pct to 50 . 0 mln dlrs from 119 . 7 mln dlrs in in 1985 .
Norcen ' s 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204 . 9 mln dlrs from 228 . 9 mln dlrs in the prior year .
It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen ' s reduced performance .
" While financial results are far from the previous year ' s record levels , it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong ," Norcen said .
It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast .
The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on profitable opportunities in its core business areas , and will continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values .
COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning , delegates said .
Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences , mostly on the issues of how much non - member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties .
Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow .
Some consuming member nations , including Britain and Belgium , favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non - member cocoa , delegates have said .
The consumers argue that buying cheaper , lower quality non - member cocoas , particularly Malaysian , will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market .
Producers , meanwhile , say non - member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer .
They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member , and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join , delegates said .
As to differentials , Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal , so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock , producer delegates said .
Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas , such as Ghanaian and Brazilian , they said .
Other technical points need to be sorted out , including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby , intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries , delegates said .
SIEMENS REBUTTS U . S .
CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER Siemens AG & lt ; SIEG . F > rebutted U . S .
Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph Corp ' s & lt ; T . N >, AT and T , entry into French telecommunications firm & lt ; Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques >, CGCT .
Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV & lt ; PGLO . AS > had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T . The French government , which owns CGCT , had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT .
The result of the negotiations was still open .
Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer .
The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E . Olson as saying that Siemens ' attempt to stop AT and T and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the U . S . Baur said he expected the French government to decide on the winning bid by the end of April .
CGCT ' s share of the French switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct .
The French government has limited CGCT participation by foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs for the whole company .
Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the initial stake .
He did not rule out a stake increase later but said Siemens ' aim was to introduce its technology .
Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm & lt ; Jeumont - Schneider SA > submitted a joint offer at the start of March because of the 20 pct limitation .
Both companies will form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT .
Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while Jeumont - Schneider will own 80 pct .
Apart from investing 100 mln francs for the modernisation of CGCT , a new research centre with was also being planned .

FORD & lt ; F > NEARS GM & lt ; GM > IN EXECUTIVE BONUSES Ford Motor Co neared General Motors Corp last year in executive bonuses , while it topped the larger automaker in profit sharing payments to workers .
Ford , which outstripped GM in earnings last year , said its 1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs , slightly behind General Motors ' 169 . 1 mln .
General Motors , however , did not make any profit - sharing payments to its workers , while Ford made a profit - sharing distribution of 372 mln dlrs , or 2 , 100 dlrs per worker .
General Motors , which saw its earnings drop to 2 . 94 billion dlrs from 1985 ' s 3 . 99 billion , said the 1986 profit was " not sufficient to generate a payout under the profit - sharing formula .
" Ford , which earned 3 . 28 billion dlrs in 1986 , up from 2 . 51 billion in 1985 , said it " recognizes employees ' efforts and fulfills its commitment to them in many ways , including profit - sharing .

MULFORD SAYS GERMANY , JAPAN SHOULD DO MORE Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities .
" I do not believe they have up to this time ," Mulford told a Senate banking subcommittee .
He said that for the U . S . trade deficit to continue improving in the next two years , " We need more policy actions " across the entire front of U . S . trade relations , including Canada and the newly - industrialized countries ( NICS ).
In particular , he said , efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing .
Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis .
He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin nations were significantly smaller than imports into the U . S .
He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained economic growth .

GERMAN RETAILERS EXPECT GOOD 1987 West German retailers expect another good year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986 , the General Association of the German Retail Trade ( HDE ) said .
HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2 . 5 pct to three pct in 1987 after last year ' s steep 3 . 7 pct rise .
Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West German retail sector .
GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS The Bundesbank ' s options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers , economists and money market dealers said .
Call money fell in quite active trading today , dropping to 3 . 40 / 50 pct from 3 . 55 / 65 pct yesterday , and below the 3 . 50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month - end approached .
But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round .
One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said , " I don ' t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens .
But it also does not want them to fall .
Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes .
" In West Germany , unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation , economists said .
Ute Geipel , economist with Citibank AG , said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy , raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term , unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands .
As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process , Geipel said .
In the current round , the country ' s most powerful union , the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers , is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38 - 1 / 2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages .
The engineering employers ' association , Gesamtmetall , is offering to bring in a 38 - hour - week from July 1 , 1988 , and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2 . 7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1 . 5 pct from July 1 , 1988 .
The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe ' s largest union , with 2 . 5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector , banks and federal post office .
Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April , ahead of the traditional holiday period in June .
Though many economists said the unions ' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984 ' s damaging seven - week strikes , others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict .
This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low - key , economists said .
The money market head said the unions ' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy .
" The unions haven ' t forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations ," he said .
In addition , the newly - elected chairman of the IG Metall union , Franz Steinkuehler , was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership .
More than 16 , 000 engineering workers at 45 firms , mainly in south Germany , held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday .
Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt - Boelkow - Blohm GmbH .
Today , 28 , 000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes , a statement from IG Metall said .
Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically - inhibited Bundesbank .
About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government .
As a result , some banks fell back on the Bundesbank ' s offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three - day treasury bills , anticipating still lower rates before the month - end .
But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday , other dealers noted .
If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday , rates could soar , perhaps to the 5 . 50 pct Lombard ceiling .
Banks were well stocked up with funds , having an average 52 . 1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March , well above the 50 . 7 billion requirement .
FOREIGN FIRMS HOPE TO JOIN JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY President Nobuo Ito of International Telecom Japan Inc ( ITJ ), one of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan ' s international telecommunications market , said it will offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms .

FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp , Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy , but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought .
In a wide - ranging interview , Pinola said he ' s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991 , " so as to resist any potential look at us ... to maintain our independence , if possible .
" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California .
First Interstate , the fourth largest California bank , and the nineth largest nationwide , owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states .
Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U . S . or foreign banks , looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region .
While declining specifics on his corporate strategy , when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan , Pinola replied , " That ' s undoubtedly a fair statement ... it would be almost naive not to think that .
" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as " opportunistic ".
He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain , then add management to restore profitability , or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates , then cut costs by combining resources .
The exception , he said , would be Texas , where he said most of the banks are already well managed , but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy .
Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica , saying only , " We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us .
" Banking analysts , however , consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot , not likely to happen any time soon .
Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3 . 25 billion dlr bid at the nation ' s second largest bank , " a very , very difficult decision .
" With that decision made , however , he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community .
" The competition in this state is tough ," he said , noting CityBank ' s recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company .
" CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth ," he said .
Outside California , Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp , with its recent acquisitions in Arizona , Washington and Oregon , is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated .
" Security is , has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company ," he said .
He added , however , First Interstate , at the moment , has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name .
Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition , First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states , where energy , real estate and agriculture dominate the economy .
Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked , he said , " I don ' t think it has bottomed out , because I think most of the problems are real estate - related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years .
" Pinola said another failing economic sector , agriculture in the Midwest , has slowed expansion of First Interstate ' s franchise operation .
First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states .
While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River , Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West , expansion into the Midwest must come first .
Calling the franchise system , " moderately profitable ," Pinola said , " It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two .
" On the banking industry in general , Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses , with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits .
