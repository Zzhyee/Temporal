We present a semantic parsing approach for temporal expression resolution. 
Previous work, including current state of the art approaches, primarily use pattern matching and regular expression-like rules for grounding temporal expressions. However, the compositionality of language suggests a more linguistically principled approach. 

In our system, using a hand-built lexicon and CCG parser, we first construct a 
base CCG parse for each temporal phrase, then build a set of candidate
context-dependent logical forms from each base parse. We learn to select one parse from this set using a perceptron and features based on the logic, the phrase itself, and, critically, the full context the in which the phrase appears. Finally, we execute this logical form to a standardized date and time representation. This approach builds on previous successes using CCG for semantic parsing, and using a small featureset of linguistically motivated features, we achieve moderate accuracy on task A of TempEval3.
